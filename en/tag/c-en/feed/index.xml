										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you want to learn one of the most popular programming languages that make finding a job a child&#8217;s play? Do you want employers to chase after you with the best jobs?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get a firm grasp of one (or more) of the programming languages below, and if your knowledge stands on firm grounds, we bet you will find a job quickly, and your programming skills will be compensated with a high salary.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the most popular programming languages?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world of technology is ever-changing, so the list of the most popular programming languages changes too:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are languages that seem like they can never be removed from the top 10 (e.g., Java, Python, JavaScript, SQL). </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, we noticed some trends in popularity—some technologies are used less and less (e.g., PHP) while others are used more widely (e.g., JavaScript).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They are also always creating new languages and technologies to solve the tasks of a particular area even more efficiently (e.g., R).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ones higher on the list of the most popular programming languages are general-purpose languages with a long history (like Java), but there are newer ones on the top 10 list as well, that have been developed for more special purposes (like R and MATLAB).</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we based our list on the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summaries of international trends: </span><a href="https://go.courses/blog/all-the-programming-languages-worth-learning-in-2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go Courses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://medium.com/@satyanageshan8/the-7-most-used-programming-languages-in-2019-and-2020-predictions-29c715c3f456" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">medium.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://hackr.io/blog/best-programming-languages-to-learn-2020-jobs-future" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hackr.io</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stackoverflow Developer Survey</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also looked at job-posting websites to see how many ads contain the programming languages below. In our article, we used the numbers of the website </span><a href="https://hu.indeed.com/jobs?q=java&amp;l=Hungary" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, since that is a meta job-posting site, meaning they compile the jobs from many other job sites. The numbers were accurate during the writing of this article, but job offers always change somewhat, of course.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Java</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Write Once, Run Anywhere”. This is what gives Java its popularity since programs written in this language can be run on any compatible device without recompiling them if Java has been installed. It is a general-purpose language that has versatile uses, like website development, or creating mobile and desktop applications. There are other Java versions available for corporate servers and other business applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also have to mention that Android is Java-based, there are many Java applications for Windows, and the corporate world and back-end programming also build heavily on this language, adding to the wide variety of job options.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 1038 Java-based programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article.</span></p>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Python</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is an easily readable, general-purpose language with an easy syntax. We can recommend this to beginners as well since Python is one of the most suitable programming languages to start learning the basics of programming. It stands on or near the top of the lists of the most popular, the most well-liked by programmers, and the easiest to learn programming languages, and has been on top for years now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine learning and AI development are the fastest developing areas of use for Python. It is also the most often used language in data science, but it isn’t unknown in the world of web programming and game development either.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 740 Python programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article.</span></p>

</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">JavaScript </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is mostly a language of websites. It is used primarily for front-end development, as this language makes most websites more interactive and dynamic, but it is starting to gain popularity on the server-side as well, with the help of the software system Node.js.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All steps of web development, and prior to that, UI and UX design (meaning the creation of user-friendly, good-looking and modern websites) have a great value on the labour market—we always need web developers. You can’t go wrong with this knowledge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 651 JavaScript programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article. </span></p>

</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">One step forward: TypeScript </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TypeScript is a scripting language created by Microsoft. The goal of developing it wasn’t the creation of another rival language, but making a tool that expands the possibilities of JavaScript so that we can do massive projects with it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 172 programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article that requires TypeScript skills or lists them as an advantage.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">C# </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With C#, we can create desktop, mobile, and web-based applications, and with the .NET framework makes it even easier to develop things for tools created by Microsoft and the Windows operating system. This framework has fused together with C# almost completely, they are usually mentioned together, and job offers generally require you to know the framework as well as the language.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are other software development platforms for C#, e.g., Unity, which has been created for game development and has since become the engine for many known games.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C# can also be suitable for writing websites and web applications using the ASP.NET framework.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C# can be used independently from Microsoft—you can write software for Xbox, Android, macOS and many more platforms.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 434 C# programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">SQL</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Structured Query Language is the standard language for data management. In our data-centric world, databases that store and process huge amounts of data are indispensable parts of our tools and services’ background processes. Experts who can create and manage databases like this are in high demand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning SQL is a worthy investment, and if you also have some other programming, data analysis, or data visualization skills, you can have a job basically anywhere since, as we have mentioned before, databases are needed everywhere.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 1300 programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article that requires SQL skills. </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12028 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">C++</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a low-level, close-to-hardware programming language that is hard to read and it is the upgraded version of the widely used C language, which is the basis for many systems. Learning this language requires strong IT and mathematical skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This language usually isn’t recommended for beginners, but this article is about programming languages that can help you find a job, and C++ certainly is one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can be used to create and fine-tune operating systems, device drivers, video games, and even desktop and mobile apps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are not a beginner, or if you are looking for long-term goals, C++ can be an amazing choice since C++ skills are valuable on the labour market. Corporations need highly-trained C++ developers who can complete especially complex and serious programming tasks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This valuable knowledge is compensated with a high salary, and senior C++ developers are among the most well-paid programmers. As newer and newer programming languages start to appear that are easier to use, the number of C++ developers are decreasing, so you are almost guaranteed a job if you are capable of working professionally in this complex language</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 362 C++ programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article.</span></p>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">PHP</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a scripting language used in web development and database management that is relatively easy to learn, and there are good and well-paid opportunities for it from the very beginning. It is popular and in high demand because one of the most popular website creation applications, WordPress, is running in PHP as well. In 2018, 83.5% of websites choose PHP as their server-side programming language, including such tech giants as Facebook, Tumblr or Slack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web developers, and more specifically, back-end or full-stack developers have many job options if they know and use PHP confidently.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">R</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">R is a field-specific programming language, used mostly for statistical analyses and the representation of their results. Nowadays, data science is a highly important and dynamically expanding area, so there are many job offers for writing statistical software and data analysis. R also plays a role in machine learning, which is also an important area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since statistical analysis is used in many fields—sciences and human research, commerce, marketing, and meteorology to name a few, R programming skills can be crucial for us not just as members of development teams, but for research groups and other things as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the infinite amount of data we are working within the 21st century, experts in data analysis and exploring correlations are becoming indispensable. So people can be sure that they will find positions in which they can make use of their R skills.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 187 programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article that mentions R.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perl</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previously, the most important language of the web had been Perl, also called “The Duct Tape of the Internet.” Today, other languages have gained considerable ground, but Perl is still a widely used general-purpose language.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They use Perl in system administration, programming networks, creating graphical user interfaces, and, of course, web development is also still on the table.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 129 Perl programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">MATLAB programming language</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lists of most popular programming languages are created using different criteria, but if we are looking at which languages are in high demand on the labour market, MatLab appears on more and more of them. MatLab is both the name of the development environment and the programming language used in that environment. It has been developed mostly for performing technical calculations, developing and testing algorithms, and creating simulations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is often used for a visual representation of scientific test results and data processing tasks. If you already have high mathematical skills or knowledge of some field of science, MatLab can become a valuable asset.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 76 MatLab programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swift </span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swift is a general-purpose, high-level programming language developed by Apple. It can be used to write programs for macOS, iOS or other Apple operating systems. It has many modern features that make development easier and more secure. It stands out from other programming languages for the same purpose in that programs are written in Swift run extremely quickly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The importance of Apple is unquestionable in the world of IT, so even if Swift isn’t one of the most popular programming languages yet, it is quickly rising, and you can already find a lot of jobs if you know it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 75 Swift programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article.</span></p>

<ul>
<li class="entry-title"><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/interview-tips-that-will-give-you-confidence-and-help-you-land-a-dev-job/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Interview tips that will give you confidence and help you land a dev job</a></li>
<li><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/category/basics-of-programming/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Basics of programming</a></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Before you learn to code, think about what you want to code</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing how to code is mostly about building things, and the path is a lot clearer when you have a sense of the end goal. If your goal is “learn to code,” without a clear idea of the kinds of programs you will write and how they will make your life better, you will probably find it a frustrating exercise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m a little ashamed to admit that part of my motivation for studying computer science was that I wanted to prove I was smart, and I wanted to be able to get Smart Person jobs. I also liked thinking about math and theory (</span><a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Godel-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this book</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> blew my mind at an impressionable age) and the program was a good fit. It wasn’t enough to sustain me for long, though, until I found ways to connect technology to the things I really loved, like music and literature.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what do you want to code? Websites? Games? iPhone apps? A startup that makes you rich? Interactive art? Do you want to be able to impress your boss or automate a tedious task so you can spend more time looking at otter pictures? Perhaps you simply want to be more employable, add a buzzword to your resume, or fulfill the requirements of your educational program. All of these are worthy goals. Make sure you know which one is yours, and study accordingly.</span></p>
<h3><b>There’s nothing mystical about it</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coding is a skill like any other. Like language learning, there’s grammar and vocabulary to acquire. Like math, there are processes to work through specific types of problems. Like all kinds of craftsmanship and art-making, there are techniques and tools and best practices that people have developed over time, specialized to different tasks, that you’re free to use or modify or discard.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/ThePerilsofJavaSchools.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This guy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (a very smart guy! Whose other writings I enjoy and frequently agree with!) posits that there is a bright line between people with the True Mind of a Programmer and everyone else, who are lacking the intellectual capacity needed to succeed in the field. That bright line consists, according to him, of pointers and recursion (there are primers </span><a href="http://alumni.cs.ucr.edu/~pdiloren/C++_Pointers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://inventwithpython.com/blog/2011/08/11/recursion-explained-with-the-flood-fill-algorithm-and-zombies-and-cats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the curious).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I learned about pointers and recursion in school, and when I understood them, it was a delightful jolt to my brain — the kind of intellectual pleasure that made me want to study computer science in the first place. But, outside of classroom exercises, the number of times I’ve had to be familiar with either concept to get things done has been relatively small. And when helping others learn, over and over again, I’ve watched people complete interesting and rewarding projects without knowing anything about either one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no point in being intimidated or wondering if you’re Smart Enough. Sure, the more complex and esoteric your task, the higher the level of mastery you will need to complete it. But this is true in absolutely every other field. Unless you’re planning to make your living entirely by your code, chances are you don’t have to be a recursion-understanding genius to make the thing you want to make.</span></p>
<h3><b>It never works the first time</b></h3>
<h4><b>And probably won’t the second or third time</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you first start learning to code, you’ll very quickly run up against this particular experience: you think you’ve set up everything the way you’re supposed to, you’ve checked and re-checked it, and it still. doesn’t. work. You don’t have a clue where to begin trying to fix it, and the error message (if you’re lucky enough to have one at all) might as well say “fuck you.” You might be tempted to give up at this point, thinking that you’ll never figure it out, that you’re not cut out for this. I had that feeling the first time I tried to write a program in C++, ran it, and got only the words “segmentation fault” for my trouble.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this experience is so common for programmers of all skill levels that it says absolutely nothing about your intelligence, tech-savviness, or suitability for the coding life. It will happen to you as a beginner, but it will also happen to you as an experienced programmer. The main difference will be in how you respond to it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve found that a big difference between new coders and experienced coders is faith: faith that things are going wrong for a logical and discoverable reason, faith that problems are fixable, faith that there is a way to accomplish the goal. The path from “not working” to “working” might not be obvious, but with patience you can usually find it.</span></p>
<h3><b>Someone will always tell you you’re doing it wrong</b></h3>
<p><a href="http://theprofoundprogrammer.com/page/17" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Braces should go on the next line</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/2782" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Braces should go on the same line</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="http://derkarl.org/why_to_tabs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use tabs to indent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TabsAreEvil" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But tabs are evil</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You should </span><a href="http://mysqlstoredprocedure.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=51&amp;Itemid=40" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">use stored procedures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but actually </span><a href="http://www.tonymarston.co.uk/php-mysql/stored-procedures-are-evil.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you shouldn’t use them</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You should </span><a href="http://www.lanoie.net/classes/DHTML/programming/lectures/lecture.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">always comment your code</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But </span><a href="http://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2013/06/01/roc-rocks.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">good code doesn’t need comments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are almost always many different approaches to a particular problem, with no single “right way.” A lot of programmers get very good at advocating for their preferred way, but that doesn’t mean it’s the One True Path. Going head-to-head with people telling me I was Wrong, and trying to figure out if they were right, was one of the more stressful aspects of my early career.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re coding in a team with other people, someone will almost certainly take issue with something that you’re doing. Sometimes they’ll be absolutely correct, and it’s always worth investigating to see whether you are, in fact, Doing It Wrong. But sometimes they will be full of shit or re-enacting an ancient and meaningless dispute where it would be best to just follow a style guide and forget about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, if you’re the kind of person who enjoys ancient but meaningless disputes (grammar nerds, I’m looking at you), you’ve come to the right place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Coding” means a lot of different things to a lot of different people, and it looks different now from how it used to. And, funnily enough, the tools and packages and frameworks that make it faster and easier for newcomers or even trained developers to build things are most likely to be tarred with the “not for REAL coders” brush. (See: “</span><a href="http://blog.enfranchisedmind.com/2009/04/return-of-the-real-programmer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Return of the Real Programmer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">”)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behind all this is the fear that </span><a href="http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2013/08/21/chase-felker-youre-not-a-computer-programmer-and-thats-ok/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">if “anyone” can call themselves a programmer, the title will become meaningless</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But I think that this gatekeeping is destructive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the tools that make it easiest to build the things you want to build. If that means your game was made in Stencyl or GameMaker rather than written from scratch, that’s fine. If your first foray into coding is HTML or Excel macros, that’s fine. Work with something you feel you can stick with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you get more comfortable, you’ll naturally start to find those tools limiting rather than helpful and look for more powerful ones. But most of the time, few people will ever even look at your code or even ask what you used — It’s what you make with it that counts.</span></p>
<h3><b>Worrying about “geek cred” will slowly kill you</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">See above. I used to worry a lot, especially in school, about whether I was identifying myself as “not a real geek” (and therefore less worthy of inclusion in tech communities) through my clothing, my presentation, my choice of reading material and even my software customization choices. It was a terrible waste of energy and I became a lot more functional after I made the decision to let it all go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to internalize this: your ability to get good at coding has </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">nothing</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to do with how well you fit into the various geek subcultures. This goes double if you know deep down that you’ll never quite fit. The energy you spend proving yourself should be going into making things instead. And, if you’re an indisputable geek with cred leaking from your eye sockets, keep this in mind for when you’re evaluating someone else’s cred level. It may not mean what you think it does.</span></p>

<h3><b>Sticking with it is more important than the method</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no shortage of articles about the “right” or “best” way to learn how to code, and there are lots of potential approaches. You can learn the concepts </span><a href="http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">from a book</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or by </span><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">completing interactive exercises</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or by </span><a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/intro.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">debugging things that others have written</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And, of course, there are lots of languages you might choose as your first to learn, with advocates for each.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A common complaint with “teach yourself to code” programs and workshops is that you’ll breeze happily through the beginner material and then hit a steep curve where things get more difficult very quickly. You know how to print some lines of text on a page but have no idea where to start working on a “real,” useful project. You might feel like you were just following directions without really understanding and blame the learning materials.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12255 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you get to this stage, most of the tutorials and online resources available to you are much less useful because they assume you’re already an experienced and comfortable programmer. The difficulty is further compounded by the fact that “you don’t know what you don’t know.” Even trying to figure out what to learn next is a puzzle in itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll hit this wall no matter what “learn to code” program you follow, and the only way to get past it is to persevere. This means you keep trying new things, learning more information, and figuring out, piece by piece, how to build your project. You’re a lot more likely to find success in the end if you have a clear idea of why you’re learning to code in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you keep putting bricks on top of each other, it might take a long time but eventually, you’ll have a wall. This is where that faith I mentioned earlier comes in handy. If you believe that with time and patience you can figure the whole coding thing out, in time you almost certainly will. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

<p><strong>I live here</strong>: Budapest, Hungary</p>

<h4>When you&#8217;re asked about your profession, how do you answer?</h4>
<p>I’m a software developer.</p>
<h4>What was your job before you started coding? Did you have any former experience in this field?</h4>
<p>When I was a child I used to look for swapped O’s and zeros in BASIC programs. I gave up an aircraft modelling workshop to draw with a Commodore+4 and I was often fiddling with GV-Basic (C64) too. I used Tubo Pascal in high school and <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/beginners-guide-to-c/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">C++</a> at university among other interesting languages. <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/beginners-guide-to-c/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">C++</a> stuck with me for quite a long time… and then machine vision, robotics and GPU programming came along.</p>
<h4>Why did you decide to start learning web development?</h4>
<p>In my opinion desktop applications are done for. Instead, I was interested in mobile development and cloud services. I wanted to learn WebGL after coming across it for the first time. I thought the first step should be recalling my web knowledge, as I had previously dealt with some <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/beginners-guide-to-php/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">PHP</a> and MySQL, but the frontend was always done by someone else. Many of my projects focused on calculation, not the interface. However, I became curious about the tricks done by <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/g/gui.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">GUI wizards</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h4>Please tell us more about what you do now, what tasks you have? What happens on a typical day?</h4>
<p>I work in a bank, so that’s a secret. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> But my job includes some daily frontend tasks.</p>
<h4>How long were you looking for a job? How did you land your current position?</h4>
<p>My previous one was like a dream job: a real dreamer mastermind, fantastic engineers, international exhibitions and a rock-solid investor. But one day I felt like it was all too much. I needed some peace and quiet to be able to hear some new voices and finally have time for my family and myself.</p>
<p>This impulse hit me in the summer. My wife had 4 weeks off, so we moved to Venice for the time. Relaxing by the lakeside made me realise how much I’m missing some intellectual activity, so I started studying…</p>
<p>Two months later I had a couple of interviews. When the news of me not working got around, one of my dorm fellows called me and said if I still love those special program languages and I’m interested in big databases, then he has an empty desk for me by his side…</p>
<h4>How did you learn programming? What kind of courses, books etc. did you use?</h4>
<p>I don’t remember anymore, it just happened. I possessed a few issues with Computerbooks. The next thing was university: György Pongor and Zoltán László. After that, I kept to online materials.</p>

<h4>&#8220;What did CodeBerry offer you? What was it like to study at our school?</h4>
<p>I read about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Node.js</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_(web_framework)" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Angular</a> and could feel the power of their combination. During my doctorate years, I fell in love with independent research, the joy of discovering something new. On the other hand, I do respect teachers who gave me a good kickstart before the journey. Learning out of blogs is really like being in a big city without a map: there are dozens of buses, many tramlines and a few undergrounds. Sometimes you need help with the directions if you actually want to get somewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/andras-p-toth-serial-entrepreneur/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Andris</a> and I meet each other every month. He told me about CodeBerry when it was just a twinkle in his eye. Later <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/web-development-story-of-arpad-binecz/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Bini</a> said he likes the idea. I thought: why not? I was probably one of the first twenty applicants. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Before it wasn’t my job to make something pretty. At the beginning of the lessons, the focus was on the frontend. I didn’t regret that though. It was very useful to be able to try everything I just learned and test my knowledge with quizzes. By the time I completed a WordPress site, CSS and I became great friends.</p>

<h4>Do you have any experience, tips or tricks to share with those who are just starting their studies?</h4>
<p>You just have to sit down and do it… I got the final push from a friend of mine: he asked me to create a responsive website for him. He took advantage of me not working at the time. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h4>What is the next step for you? What direction are you taking?</h4>
<p>As soon as I&#8217;ll have a few spare weekends, I&#8217;ll steer back to my original goal, WebGL. Maybe Spiced up with some VR.</p>
