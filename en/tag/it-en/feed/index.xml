										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The terms remote work and home office can be heard and read more and more frequently. But what do they actually mean if we try to look under the surface and put aside our associations? What opportunities arise if we choose to work from home, and what situations can it solve?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we’ll look at remote job opportunities, and why many people choose this lifestyle. We will also talk about how we can find a new profession if we want to work from home. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also read my personal story about how I came to work at home and what experiences I have about working at a company where every coworker works remotely.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remote work &#8211; what do we mean by that?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before I tell you my story, let’s take a look at what remote work is. Let’s separate work you have to take home out of necessity or the work people must do at home, and just talk about people who can decide where they want to work under the right conditions and choose to work at home.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The spring of 2020, and the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on our working habits</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strict measures have been introduced in many parts of the world over the outbreak of the COVID epidemic, which has included restrictions on leaving home and a firm recommendation that whoever can do their job from home should do that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of people experienced the advantages and disadvantages of remote work this way—not under ideal conditions. This sudden change caused them anxiety, with their employers being unprepared, and kids learning from home. The change was felt in many ways; some experienced only the positive side of working from home, while others wanted nothing more than to be able to go to their workplaces again.</span></p>
<p><div style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1547586696-ea22b4d4235d?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=750&amp;q=80" alt="With remote working you can spare time and money" width="750" height="500" /><p class="wp-caption-text">With remote working, you can spare the time of sitting in a traffic jam on your way to the office.

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Temporary home office or long-term remote work?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is good practice to separate temporary home offices from long-term, well-organized remote work, since ideally, this is not a form of work that most people want to escape from. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By home office, we mean when an employee stays a few days (or more, because of the coronavirus situation) at home, but can be reached during her working hours, uses company equipment, and does office work from home. We might think this is convenient, because we don’t have to go to work in the morning, and can complete our tasks from the comfort of our home, on our couch, maybe even in pyjamas. This may not be optimal for everyone, but this article is not about their work efficiency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others may think about remote work as work that they “bring home”, which invades their privacy, making it difficult for them to have a family meal, or free time on the weekend without worrying about their jobs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To us, long-term remote work means much more. We create conditions that let us work efficiently and pleasantly from home. This can apply to many professions and jobs: you can be an entrepreneur, a freelancer or even an employee who chooses to make their home their workplace. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who works remotely, and why?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well-organized remote work can be an ideal choice in many situations. It can help those who don’t get any job offers near their home. Commuting daily can be exhausting, expensive, and time-consuming, so remote work seems ideal in these situations in many aspects.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">People who can’t get to their workplaces easily</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some people choose remote work because of their </span><b>disability</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><b>other health reasons</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some families work from home while bringing up children to be able to create a more stable financial situation and a </span><b>balanced family life</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">People who live far from cities</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of people leave their past in the city behind and </span><b>start a new life in the countryside</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, far from all the noise and traffic. This doesn’t mean they have to give up their old jobs if they can be done remotely. Of course, for most people, moving to a new place means changing their lifestyle, </span><b>starting a new profession,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and leaving their old one. But if they want to make sure that they have income, remote work can be a great choice if they have a valuable, sought-after job.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital nomads—the “I-always-work-from-wherever” lifestyle</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new lifestyle started to take hold of people in the 21st century, called the </span><b>“digital nomad”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lifestyle. People who choose to live this way are always on the road exploring the world while working remotely. They only need a laptop and a reliable internet connection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the </span><a href="https://www.adventurouskate.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website of Adventurous Kate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can follow her adventures around the world since 2010. Her business is built up around this idea as well—she teaches women (remotely, of course) about how they can travel safely. There is also </span><a href="https://digitalisnomad.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a Hungarian digital nomad blog</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, if you are interested in the pros and cons of this travelling-while-working lifestyle of an English teacher.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And </span><a href="https://www.digitalnomadsoul.com/digital-nomad-blogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here are 31 exciting blogs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if you want to learn even more about the digital nomad lifestyle.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What work can be done from home? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The spectrum is wider than we would think at first, and the list of opportunities always gets longer. Big, international companies started to offer partially or fully remote jobs. On job-seeking platforms (like LinkedIn), you can </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?keywords=remote" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filter for remote work,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and there are sites that specialize in remote work exclusively, for example, </span><a href="https://weworkremotely.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We work remotely</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of creative work (graphic designer, photographer, video editor, copywriter, designer, etc.) can be done remotely. In a corporate environment, there are countless positions where keeping in contact is the only condition, meaning you don’t have to be present in person. These jobs can also be remote work if the operation of the company allows it e.g., in the HR area, in customer services, as consultants, in the marketing area, as contact people, or as a salesman, etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the IT field, most tasks can be completed from home, in software and web development, UX design, data science or any other specialization if the structure of the company and the ways of communication allow it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Occasional jobs can also be done remotely, like translation, data recording and opinion polling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a profession, skill or talent that you could use to start a business or work as a freelancer for other companies, you can also try creating the perfect work environment at your home. </span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">My experience with remote work</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">From interpreter to copywriter</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the spring of 2020, I couldn’t continue working as I had been, as a freelancer, which had been my main source of income due to the coronavirus outbreak. I was working as an interpreter, and due to the mandatory shutdown, the number of my orders decreased.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had to find a new job, so I applied for many positions where I could work remotely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was important for me that the job I apply to gives me a bit of flexibility since I wanted to do my own work schedule so that I could continue my occasional interpreting jobs as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At CodeBerry Programming School, I found the opportunity to have a constant, reliable source of income while working on exciting and creative processes and still having time for other important things in my life. At this company, a hundred percent of the work is done remotely. Every coworker works from home, joining this dynamically and smoothly operating team from all over the world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12028 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do people communicate with each other at a company that works completely remotely?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communication and project management within the company happens with the help of a few pieces of software that had been developed to handle exactly these tasks. We use the chat application Slack to keep in touch instead of emails, and we create channels for each work team, for reporting bugs and other technical problems, for program organization, etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We use </span><a href="https://basecamp.com/welcome-back" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basecamp</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to follow up on project planning and scheduling, and we get to look at the work of other teams there as well. We also see the events of the week and our tasks for the next week on Basecamp, and we plan things in 6 + 2-week-long project cycles. We follow the completion of each subtask on </span><a href="https://trello.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trello</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meetings are held on </span><a href="https://zoom.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoom</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and we handle documents on Google interfaces that can be edited together (like Docs and Sheets). Every file (e.g., meeting notes, articles, spreadsheets, notes) can be accessed by all coworkers.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pros and cons of working from home – a subjective viewpoint</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most positive thing about remote work for me is that I can choose the time when I want to work, and can adjust it week-by-week if necessary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be efficient, I always plan ahead and mark exactly when I will do my tasks—in the morning, the whole day, at night, or maybe on the weekend, and I mark when I have other activities. If the next season or situation requires some other schedule, I can adjust it as much as I like.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a great advantage for me that I am not tied down to a place, so I can work from abroad, from the countryside, from the capital, from a library, a café or an office, or from home. This gives me great security, so I don’t have to worry about how I can get to work if something changes (if I move, for example). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By choosing remote work, a few things fundamentally changed in my everyday life. I spend less time traveling, so I can spend that valuable time on something else, and I don’t even have to stress about being late and being in crowds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, we have to struggle with the decrease in human relationships, and we have to find other ways of connection since we don’t see our colleagues much, even through a screen, when we work from home. To have a good workplace environment, we need to talk, laugh and eat together. We need to find these impulses elsewhere when we work remotely. This might help you focus on your work, but can cause problems for people who need the company.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning remotely is also worth it</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to improve yourself or want to change your profession, you have many opportunities to train yourself further. Learn, practice new skills or make your hobby your profession. Find what you are talented in, and what you would like to do as a job. If you want to work remotely in the long-term, acquire skills that can make it possible for you.</span></p>

</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we are going to go through some points that might come up when you are taking your first steps in getting to know the basics of programming. We will do a short introduction of the most popular programming areas and languages, talk about the issues around making some big decisions (about what technology and learning format to choose) and say a few words about the personal and technical background necessary for this venture. We will also make some book and video tutorial recommendations in the hope of motivating you to start studying.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12017 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h2>Programming as an umbrella term – and its many meanings</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we hear that someone is a programmer, we can already assume that he is doing some complex and interesting work that requires a lot of careful attention. But that is not really enough information for us to tell what he actually does, what an average day of his is like, and what kind of tasks he has to deal with. Coding is such a diverse field that it can be considered only a very generic term in this form, spreading over countless areas as a giant umbrella. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, there is one thing that all these areas have in common: they all involve communication with computers. And the way to do that is writing program codes, which is done by programmers. (Who also do testing, debugging, and documenting; they communicate with clients, learn and teach, do teamwork or work individually on a personal project.) If you would like to learn more about the above-mentioned communication through descriptive examples, check out our article titled </span><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/a-brief-introduction-to-programming/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Brief Introduction to Programming</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what do we mean when we say that programming is present in countless areas? Think about all the various devices, applications, platforms you use daily. Software for web pages, mobile apps, games, desktop applications, embedded devices (for example, smart household appliances), and so on—the list is infinite. Creating and operating each of these involves different programming areas and technologies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Different criteria are applied and different technologies are needed for designing and creating the things that you see as a user, and those running on the server-side. Various technologies call for various programming languages.</span></p>
<h2>The most popular programming languages</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several surveys looking at the most popular programming languages. But what exactly do we mean by popular? Surveys conducted in this subject are not looking for the best programming language, as there is no “best programming language”—only adequate and less adequate ones for a given task, need, or purpose, and ones that can or cannot be used in a given situation or for a given platform. The </span><a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">source</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we used when writing this article shows the languages in which the biggest number of lines were written in a particular month, so technically, it measures which languages are used the most. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to this, most of the code written was created in Java, C, Python, C++, and C</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">♯</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Visual Basic, JavaScript, SQL, PHP, and R are also quite high up in the rankings. The diagram clearly shows how the popularity of languages has changed over time. There are several things to consider when you decide to learn one or the other programming language, the most important of which is the purpose you need it for, your goals relevant to programming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can read some hints and tips on finding the right programming language for you in our article titled </span><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/which-programming-language-is-right-for-you/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which Programming Language is Right for You?</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2>The many ways of gaining new skills – Learning the basics of programming</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many ways to get started when you want to learn something new, and programming is no exception either. But whatever learning method you choose, you will need patience, perseverance, and diligence if you want to learn to code.</span></p>
<h3>Individual learning</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Individual learning can be an attractive option for several reasons. One of its biggest advantages is that you can set your own schedule, spend as much time on studying as you want, and study whenever it is most convenient for you. You can fit the pace and the frequency of reviewing and practicing to your personal needs; you can go back and forth in the material as needed; you don’t have to adjust to others. For the individual study, it is best to use multiple resources, check out online learning materials, tutorials, books, and find the format that suits you best. You don’t have to stick to one particular method, various methods could complement each other perfectly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, learning by yourself also has a flip side: apart from forums, you don’t have many channels where you can ask for help if you get stuck. The external motivation that your peers and mentors would bring can make a real difference in your growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are hybrid solutions too, combining the benefit of studying at your own pace and the support of a student community and mentors. That is also how it is done at CodeBerry, where you can join a virtual community and receive online mentoring. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12028 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3>Courses and higher education programs</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also choose from a wide range of options if you would like to study in a course, with well-prepared instructors, enthusiastic classmates, and a carefully structured curriculum. When talking about courses, most of us would probably think of “offline”, classroom-based education, which has many excellent opportunities for team building, developing communication skills, and fun lessons spent together. But you can also learn programming in online courses, from anywhere in the world. If there are no coding courses where you live or you don’t want to waste time or money on commuting, then online courses are the right choice for you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also study coding on the university level, which involves acquiring a much larger theoretical knowledge base, but much less practical experience. You will get to understand complex mathematical problems and gain a deep understanding of operations running in the background of programming. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can find more tips on how to learn the basics of programming in our post titled </span><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/how-to-learn-to-code/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Learn to Code</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including a more detailed account of various learning formats and beginner-friendly coding languages. </span></p>
<h2>Technical requirements</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have been interested in programming for some time and you have gathered a lot of information on it already, or you are no stranger to the IT scene (you just haven’t happened to start coding yet), then you will be familiar with the expressions used in this section. If you are coming from a different background and haven’t had anything to do with coding yet, then maybe you’ll be wondering about similar questions as the ones below. </span></p>
<h3>Computer and operating system</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What kind of computer and operating system is needed for programming; what do these need to be capable of? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can write code on a simple laptop or desktop computer; you don’t need to get a supercomputer developed by NASA. The most common commercial operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS) will be perfectly enough. </span></p>
<h3>Development environment</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where do I write the code? What environment should I use? You can write programs in text editors, integrated development environments, or online editing platforms. They all have their advantages, and everyone can choose the option that suits their work, needs, and wallet the best.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to work in a text editor, you can use the Atom, Notepad++, Sublime Text, etc. platforms. These allow you to write and edit your code comfortably, they ensure a clear presentation and have a number of extra features such as syntax highlighting and a help menu. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Integrated development environments (or IDEs) are applications that recognize the syntax of the given language, help prevent bugs, and create nested code. They also have templates, and they can be customized through additional plug-ins and preferences. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eclipse, Visual Studio Code, Webstorm</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, etc. are all examples for IDEs. Companies often require their developers to work in a certain IDE, and buy them access to a professional development environment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, as a beginner (and in many coding areas later on as well), simple online editing platforms, such as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">codepan.io</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">repl.it</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, will serve you just fine</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At CodeBerry, one of the first things you will learn is to create a development environment for yourself and get to know GitHub, a free online platform where you can store and share your code. Of course, there are other version control applications available beside </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">GitHub</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> too: for example, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitbucket</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">GitLab</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2>What skills are needed for programming?</h2>
<h3>Analytical thinking</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are thinking about enrolling in a university-level programming course, you should know that you will need very strong skills and knowledge of mathematics to start with, and you won’t be able to go around that. Contrary to this, other courses, practice-oriented training, and individual learning can be successful even when requiring much less or not as deep theoretical knowledge as university programs do, so you usually don’t need such high-level math for them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What you will definitely need though is logical, analytical thinking. In order to understand and learn algorithms, you will need a deep, analytical, rational thinking, if not traditional mathematical capabilities. You will also have to know certain basic concepts and understand basic programming operations. It is best to practice these a lot, and to go back to them from time to time, so you can use them with absolute confidence. </span></p>
<h3>Coding courses in your native language and the role of English in programming</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The role of the English language in programming is an important question. Many people could feel discouraged by not having solid English skills, while the world of IT seems to be working mostly in English. So how can you enter it if you happen to have some shortcomings in this regard? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CodeBerry offers a solution to this problem by providing an opportunity to learn coding in your native language, and there are more and more resources (books, podcasts, videos, courses) available in Hungarian. You can find some recommendations in this article. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So you don’t necessarily need strong English skills to start learning and to improve your programming skills successfully. Still, it is well worth it to work on your English skills: the ability to read international forums, articles, novelties and descriptions, the labor market advantages that come with it and the access to the global IT scene are just some of the reasons for which you should get better acquainted with the language of international communication.</span></p>
<h3>Personal skills</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an article on the basics of programming, we can’t skip mentioning what every enthusiastic beginner should be aware of: the persistence and deep focus needed for learning to code and to work as a programmer. Whatever format you are learning in, you won’t be successful without diligence and disciplined practice. But if you have these, you can immerse yourself in rewarding creative work, exciting and challenging problem-solving processes, and you will gain a substantial advantage on the job market. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12019 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3>Teamwork skills</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you think of coding as more than a hobby, and you can see yourself working as a professional programmer, chances are that you will have to work in a team or cooperate with clients, which requires good communication and cooperative skills. It is also important that you can present what you are working on, the relevant issues, and your findings in a clear, concise, and efficient manner. These are all skills that can be improved, and which are essential for efficient programming teamwork.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is impossible to include every aspect of the basics of programming in a single article, but we hope that you could find some useful insights in this post. If you are reading this to research the topic before starting to learn to code, have a look at </span><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/things-i-wish-someone-had-told-me-when-i-was-learning-how-to-code/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this personal account of the beginnings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the challenges, and the beauty of learning to code.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Árpád Binecz</strong> (Bini) started as an embedded software engineer, worked at a startup, founded his own company and now, with a twist, he’s creating websites as a junior site builder. Enjoy our interview with one of our former students in the second episode of &#8220;<a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/category/codeberry-student-stories/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">CodeBerry Student Stories&#8221;.</a></p>
<h3><strong>What was your job before you shifted to web development?</strong></h3>
<p>I have a degree in electrical engineering. I worked as an embedded software engineer at an automotive company for four years. I also worked at a startup as well as starting my own leisure time managing company that I&#8217;ve since sold.</p>
<h3><strong>What does an embedded software engineer do?</strong></h3>
<p>An embedded software engineer develops circuits, not for computers, but rather for microwaves or cars. These circuits make things happen with a push of a button.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>Did your original profession make studying any easier?</strong></h3>
<p>Quite a bit, e.g. in algorithmic thinking.</p>
<h3><strong>Why did you decide to switch to web development?</strong></h3>
<p>First of all, I was really interested in IoT (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Internet of Things – ed.</a>) I knew the tools pretty well due to my original profession, but I had no idea how things would appear in a browser. I was curious. After all, I studied to become an engineer because I like understanding things. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Secondly, I would like to continue entrepreneurship and this topic seems just right for that: by starting with some unique websites than creating a small digital agency. A lot of people did the same thing in my environment and it looks like an accomplishable and rather cool path to walk.</p>
<h3><strong>When you&#8217;re asked about your profession, how do you answer?</strong></h3>
<p>Depends on who’s asking — someone laic or a friend of mine from tech school. In the first case, I’m an IT newbie. Otherwise, a junior site builder.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12018 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3>What does that mean? How does your typical day pass?</h3>
<p>We develop big IT systems at Apertus Kft.; I’m responsible for a small part of that. Keeping it simple: I receive ready designs and turn them into websites. I work on the looks, but for example, a clickable button is not my job.</p>
<p>To be a bit metaphoric, this is how I would describe the site builder profession: it’s a great jumpstart, with a kind of knowledge that sticks fast and makes it possible to stand with two feet on the quaggy ground of web technologies as well as the IT labor market.</p>
<h3><strong>Which languages do you use daily?</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/a-brief-introduction-to-web-development/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">HTML5, CSS3, SCSS, and Bootstrap.</a> I also used JQuery once. As a site builder, I create the pieces that the lead developer then uses to complete the website.</p>

<h3><strong>Do you enjoy your job? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong></h3>
<p>Yes. My colleagues are fun. I’m just a little unsatisfied with myself because I feel I could do better and learn faster.</p>
<h3><strong>How long did you spend looking for a job?</strong></h3>
<p>I left my previous job in June, started studying in July, and was working by the beginning of September. I got an offer through friends.</p>
<h3><strong>Did you use anything else than CodeBerry for your studies?</strong></h3>
<p>No, only CodeBerry.</p>

<h3><strong>Can you give advice to newbies as a former student?</strong></h3>
<p>I think it’s worth having an overview of the whole field before choosing a technology and diving deep into that. It’s enough to know the smallest sellable unit thoroughly instead of knowing a little bit of everything.</p>
<p>For instance, HTML5, CSS3, SCSS and Bootstrap are a great combo. You can easily become a junior developer with those.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>András P. Tóth</strong> studied computer science engineering at Budapest University of Technology and now works as a serial entrepreneur in the IT sector. He&#8217;s currently building <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">CodeBerry Programming School</a> with his friends. They hope to decrease the shortage of IT professionals in Hungary.</p>
<p>During the interview, Andris told us the story of his first [$110] salary and his first company sale as well as the cats of Instagram and the path lying in front of Hungarian developers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I live here</strong>: Budapest, Hungary.</p>
<p><strong>I work here</strong>: mostly at home, sometimes from internet cafés.</p>
<p><strong>I use</strong>: iPhone | MacBook Air | <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Sublime Text</a> | <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">bash</a> | PHP | <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Node.js</a> | <a href="https://mailchimp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Mailchimp</a> | Google</p>
<p><strong>My work style in a few words</strong>: small steps every day.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>When you&#8217;re asked about your profession, how do you answer?</h4>
<p>I usually say I build enterprises. If I see confusion, I add that I create enterprises in the IT sector. My job is to give other people jobs.</p>
<h4>Tell me more about what you do regarding programming?</h4>
<p>Normally I’m occupied by several different projects at once – some are for-profit (like CodeBerry Programming School), some are non-profit ones (e.g. Invisible University, <a href="http://yearcompass.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">YearCompass</a>). Sometimes, I just code to relax.</p>
<p>We started CodeBerry Programming School in 2016 with a few friends. We teach programming to people who’ve never done it before and help them find a job. Among other various tasks, I have plenty of things to do as a developer at this company:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m one of the code mentors who help students with technical things.</li>
<li>I write lots of code for our website as well as places where it connects to other software, like surveys, analytics and payment solutions.</li>
<li>I create modules for the system dealing with the programming homework, like admin statistics, badges, progression indicators.</li>
</ul>
<p>I relax by programming different little things I find interesting at that given moment. Some of my recent projects include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instagram script that gained followers for <a href="https://www.instagram.com/safranektheordinarycat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">our cat’s Instagram</a>.</li>
<li>Slack bot that creates photos of every teammate.</li>
<li>Temperature graph (with data collected by sensors).</li>
<li>Chrome plugin that shares the view of the webcam with another computer.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4></h4>
<h4>When, where and how did you learn to code?</h4>
<p>I was 10 years old when we got a C64 for Christmas. I learned programming with the help of books and friends. We had a little team captivated by the demoscene subculture, we all wanted to create art. We drew, composed music, programmed and, of course, competed with each other.</p>
<p>My first paid job was creating a webshop for an Italian company when I was sixteen. With the help of a dial-up internet connection, I would go online each night and attempt putting together a working website from code snippets I found on the internet. I was 18 when I applied to university where I studied computer science engineering.</p>
<p>In my third year, I started working as a developer and project manager. A year later I created my first company.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>How does your workspace look like?</h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>What are the job opportunities for web developers? On average, how much time did you spend looking for a job?</h4>
<p>I have never looked for a job before. Until the middle of my university studies, people always approached me with developer jobs and, after that, I always worked for my own company. I still get emails via LinkedIn every other week, asking if I’m interested in developer jobs, so I think the market is pretty open to us.</p>
<h4>What is your daily, weekly, yearly schedule like?</h4>
<p>Usually, I get up between 6:30 and 7:30 in the morning, depending on meetings. I work out, take a shower, have breakfast, and work until midday. I have lunch with someone, then work again until five, and then I try and relax.</p>
<p>Mostly, I work from home, so sometimes I doze off in the afternoon, but that results in late-night work. That is not good for anyone.</p>
<p>Most of the times I apply the Pomodoro technique to my work—25 minutes of work followed by a 5-minute rest filled with some chores.</p>
<p>We have operative discussions on Monday and strategic discussions every Tuesday morning. Tuesday to Thursday we all work from our home offices, and Friday we organize live or online meetings to summarize the week.</p>
<p>My job is rather diverse—a part of it is communication (insider conversations, outsider meetings, and code mentoring), a part of it is marketing (managing ads, writing copy, and getting marketing systems to work), and some of it is technical (all kinds of programming tasks).</p>
<p>Four times a year, I take a week off. I also have a few day trips with my colleagues twice a year.<br />
The Invisible University causes two weeks every six months to be rather packed (at the beginning and the end of each semester), and the YearCompass results in an intensive December and January. These make me accept fewer other jobs in these periods.</p>
<h4>What surprised you about this job that you never thought of before?</h4>
<p>Time flies when you program. I start solving a problem and two blinks later it’s already night time. This really surprised me first.</p>
<p>The other thing is the speed with which the whole programming knowledge evolves. I occupied myself with marketing for a few years and when I returned to programming, I could hardly understand what my colleagues were talking about.</p>
<p>It must have been a similar feeling to what elderly people experience when their children try to explain things they can’t catch up with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Do you have skills that would surprise everyday people?</h4>
<p>When somebody asks for help from us (e.g. “the internet is down” or “the printer doesn’t work”), we usually don’t know the solution right away either. All we do is patiently read the error message and find the answer on the internet.</p>
<h4>Who do you work with?</h4>
<p>I work alone a lot. We have weekly meetings, and chat each day with colleagues, if we work on tasks together. I also exchange emails with suppliers, partners, consultants, and the press frequently.</p>
<h4>What are the typical career paths in your profession?</h4>
<p>I think there are a few pronounced paths for IT professionals:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can choose the size and style of the company: freelancer, startup, small business, medium business, multinational and governmental companies.</li>
<li>You can choose a topic: operating, developing, planning, testing or even management, sales, support, growth, data, etc.</li>
<li>You’re distinct by your experience: entry-level, junior, senior, etc.<br />
and within each path, there are many specific junctions (e.g. a developer could be an Angular specialist front-end web developer)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can choose to navigate through these routes all through your life.</p>
<p>I see many examples among my friends too:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s popular to go from zero to infinite on the programming path.</li>
<li>There are plenty of “I started as an IT specialist but found out I was good with people, so I became manager” situations.</li>
<li>There are a few “I started at multinational companies, but I’m trying to build my own business”.</li>
<li>And few of my friends start off with running their own company in the first place.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What are your plans, how do you wish to continue?</h4>
<p>I’m over my first company sale (“Gyümölcstárhely”, a web hosting service was my first company, that was bought by one of Europe’s biggest hosting companies) and many failed projects too. So far, I really enjoyed this entrepreneur-developer combination, so it’s probably what I’m going to continue.</p>
<h4>What other profession would you choose if you had to change? Could you change?</h4>
<p>I wouldn’t change. I really enjoy teaching, so I can imagine doing some kind of consultant-trainer thing. I could probably change to a normal IT job and possibly marketing due to my entrepreneurship experience.</p>
<h4>What skills do great developers, IT experts require? Who do you not recommend this profession to?</h4>
<p>I find the following skills important:</p>
<ul>
<li>Engagement in details – it’s pretty difficult to code in a superficial style. You have to pay attention to the details.</li>
<li>The capability of concentration – finding a single error sometimes takes hours.</li>
<li>Proper English skills – if I’m stuck, I can only find help on the internet in English.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t recommend this profession if you don’t have these skills.</p>
<h4>What’s your favourite part?</h4>
<p>I love programs you can leave running for hours, days or weeks, doing something useful. Creating something that works is also a great feeling.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12255 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h4>What grinds your gears most? What are the difficulties and dangers of your profession?</h4>
<p>The &#8220;professional religious wars&#8221; are both annoying and entertaining. Seeing people fight over text editors and whether you should format code with tabs or spaces&#8230;</p>
<p>It’s not easy to keep up with the constantly changing technology—deciding on which program language to use or which new tool is good enough to be learned.</p>
<p>Plus, there are dangers in this profession:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sitting all day – you need some extra effort if you don’t want to end up being a fat geek.</li>
<li>The bubble – it’s easy to think a company packed with IT professionals are all well-paid 20-50-year old men who understand programming jokes.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How stable is your job? How much time does one spend working for the same company?</h4>
<p>I work in a startup. There are faster-changing projects, undeveloped processes, and bigger uncertainty compared to a bigger, well-functioning company. I worked for 5-6 years in my previous companies; we always started new ones after that.</p>
<p>I have never heard of an IT professional being fired among my friends. Some are more loyal and work decades at the same company, while others change every few years, motivated by higher wages and more interesting roles.</p>
<h4>If you had to ask for one thing in the name of all developers, what would it be?</h4>
<p>As an IT specialist, I would ask, please read the error messages and Google them before you call us.</p>
<p>As an entrepreneur, I wish for clear and understandable emails when seeking help after something goes wrong—what have they tried, what did they expect and what happened instead—and we’ll think of the solution together.</p>
<h4>How much can one earn in this profession (as a newbie, experienced and veteran)?</h4>
<p>In my experience as an entrepreneur:</p>
<ul>
<li>I didn’t make a penny during the first year. I only fed the project with my money.</li>
<li>The first month after the tipping point I could pay myself $110. Later my salary slowly grew to $15,000.</li>
<li>I gained a bigger amount by selling my company. Enough to cover all expenses in the next 4-5 years, letting me focus on my next project.</li>
</ul>
<p>My developer friends usually make more than that. Most of the time, they have a secrecy agreement, so we can only speak of approximates: they make $15,000-30,000 in Hungary, more as a leader, and well over $70,000 in the West. It’s worth browsing <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Glassdoor</a>; they have a lot of info about salaries.</p>
<h4>What do you think is the best way to learn to code?</h4>
<p>There are a lot of great online and offline courses. We collected these on a website: http://programozastanfolyam.com./</p>
<p>The following things helped me the most:</p>
<ul>
<li>Actually having to type the solution to a given task (instead of reading it in a book or watching a video about it)</li>
<li>Specific projects that I could finish (e.g. I’ll build a site for a friend or a project)</li>
<li>A friend or mentor who already knew how to code and could help me when I had problems.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What makes code worth learning?</h4>
<p>For me, programming:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lets me experience creating something.</li>
<li>Offers job opportunities and stable financial support.</li>
<li>Is relaxing.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Adam Freisinger</strong> finished his studies as a Pharmacist and Health Care Manager, but ended up working as a web developer. Since then he has founded two IT companies. One of them being <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">CodeBerry</a>, a programming school that teaches web development online in english.</p>
<p>Tune in to read more about adventure games written in BASIC, winding copper wires for RAM cores and artificial intelligence. Along with that, we&#8217;ll also discuss the entrepreneur lifestyle of Adam Freisinger.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I live in: </strong>Budapest, Hungary.</p>
<p><strong>I work:</strong> wherever my laptop is / CodeBerry programming school</p>
<p><strong>I work with:</strong> my iPhone, MacBook Air and Sublime Text.</p>
<p>I have an efficient work style.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What do you do for a living?</strong></p>
<p>I help people learn to code.</p>
<p><strong>Tell me more about what you do regarding programming?</strong></p>
<p>I improve <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">lesson content</a> for Codeberry, so they are easier to teach and more comprehensible. This involves less coding and more creative thinking.<br />
In my free time, I fiddle with my hobby projects, that are normally tools for things I’m interested in. Recently I built the following three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>A social playlist for Spotify,</li>
<li>A Chrome extension, that quotes famous books on a new tab,</li>
<li>Software that allows me to organize my projects as well as my CodeBerry goals.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How does your workspace look like?</strong></p>
<p>I feel best in a minimalistic environment, so my desk only contains things I use:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-5810 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Adam_Freisinger_pic1-2.jpeg" alt="That’s the place where the lessons of Codeberry are made" width="800" height="600" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">My workstation (Credit: Adam Freisinger)</p>
<p><strong>When, where and how did you learn to code?</strong></p>
<p>I got a computer when I was in elementary school and my parents thought I needed to know how to use it. So, every week a friend would come over and teach me the fundamentals. I really enjoyed writing my first run-around adventure game in BASIC.</p>
<p>I continued with things I found interesting, like writing a <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/dcplusplus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">DC++</a> chatbot or building a website for my father. When they published the new version of Meteor framework I couldn&#8217;t resist building a web application with it.</p>
<p>Most of my knowledge comes from searching the internet. I would browse a larger topic, then dig deeper into puzzling details.</p>
<p><strong>What are the job opportunities for web developers? On average, how much time did you spend looking for a job?</strong></p>
<p>Due to the fact that I graduated as a Pharmacist and Health Care Manager, I never looked for jobs in programming. I took on some small tasks that found me and lead to bigger tasks. Now, I&#8217;m working in my own company taking on several roles, whatever&#8217;s needed.</p>
<p>Seeing that people regularly contact me on <a href="http://linkedin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="http://upwork.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Upwork</a>, even with very little information available, this is a demanding job.</p>
<p><strong>What is your schedule like?</strong></p>
<p>I like to get up early because it&#8217;s still quiet both inside and out. I plan my day, drink some fruit juice and start working after breakfast. I also go over special events that happened on the previous day.</p>
<p>During a business week, the first one and a half days are dedicated to strategy and Friday is for reviews. Between the two I have time to work without distractions.</p>
<p>I like reviewing my personal life too, my partner and I write down each week things we enjoyed and others that need changing.</p>
<p>Twice a week I try to meet somebody for lunch that I haven&#8217;t seen for a while.</p>
<p>My weeks, months and years are similar to my days. I like to plan at the beginning of each period and look back at the end to attempt to learn from it. Every month, I collect the photos I have taken from the previous month. I also complete the <a href="http://www.yearcompass.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">YearCompass</a> every year.</p>
<p><strong>Is there something you know that would surprise everyday people?</strong></p>
<p>Programming is not magic. It mostly involves internet research. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><strong>Who do you work with?</strong></p>
<p>I work with my friends that I have worked with for eight years on projects like Codeberry.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What are the typical career paths in your profession?</strong></p>
<p>As a Pharmacist, I could have walked a well-defined life path, but I left that certainty behind. Right now, my task is to do things within the company that requires me to reach beyond the limits of what is known.</p>
<p>This gives me the opportunity to constantly learn something new and improve myself. I don&#8217;t have a certain path before me now and it makes me feel like I can become anything I want.</p>
<p><strong>What are your plans, how do you wish to continue?</strong></p>
<p>The expression &#8220;jack of all trades, master of none&#8221; describes my path best. I would like to experience as many things as I can and learn a little about each of them. I am much like a duck wanting to both fly and swim, however, not mastering either of them.</p>
<p>I hope to find a winding path between &#8220;some trades&#8221; and &#8220;all trades.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>What other profession would you choose if you had to change? Could you change?</strong></p>
<p>I wouldn’t want to change.</p>
<p><strong>What skills do great developers, IT experts require? Who do you not recommend this profession to?</strong></p>
<p>There are a few skills that don’t hurt:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strong analytical thinking,</li>
<li>An experimenting spirit,</li>
<li>Attention to details.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What’s your favourite part?</strong></p>
<p>I enjoy seeing fast results. I can change the world by simply editing a code. I would probably be a terrible nuclear power plant designer, who plans something with all their heart then, if lucky, sees the steps of their design begin several years later.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12018 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What grinds your gears most? What are the difficulties and dangers of your profession?</strong></p>
<p>You no longer need to know how to build RAM modules to browse websites. Similarly, there are plenty of pre-written programs that stop you from seeing things further.</p>
<p>It makes me mad when I have to rewrite a login module, instead of taking advantage of pre-defined elements. There are too many different solutions for the same problem, we&#8217;re being inefficient this way.</p>
<p><strong>How stable is your job? How much time does one spend working for the same company?</strong></p>
<p>Right now, I’m pretty sure I would find a job.<br />
I feel lucky because I can afford to work somewhere as long as I can focus on my tasks, improve and learn new things. If this changed, I would want to quit.</p>
<p><strong>If you had to ask for one thing in the name of all developers, what would it be?</strong></p>
<p>Please don’t write the same code twice. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><strong>How much can one earn in this profession (as a newbie, experienced and veteran)?</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to the years spent saving some money, I now have the opportunity to work for my own business. I hope we can afford some paychecks soon, as now only my enthusiasm pushes me forward.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12255 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What do you think is the best way to learn to code?</strong></p>
<p>One answer doesn’t fit all, everyone has to learn the way they can do best. For me, it’s easiest via real projects. Whenever I’m stuck I just seek help.</p>
<p><strong>What makes code worth learning?</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, programming is like a foreign language; it helps understand other cultures and change your entire life if you want it to. Secondly, it’s a profession that surely won’t disappear in the next decades (or until artificial intelligence takes over).</p>
