										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you want to learn one of the most popular programming languages that make finding a job a child&#8217;s play? Do you want employers to chase after you with the best jobs?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get a firm grasp of one (or more) of the programming languages below, and if your knowledge stands on firm grounds, we bet you will find a job quickly, and your programming skills will be compensated with a high salary.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the most popular programming languages?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world of technology is ever-changing, so the list of the most popular programming languages changes too:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are languages that seem like they can never be removed from the top 10 (e.g., Java, Python, JavaScript, SQL). </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, we noticed some trends in popularity—some technologies are used less and less (e.g., PHP) while others are used more widely (e.g., JavaScript).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They are also always creating new languages and technologies to solve the tasks of a particular area even more efficiently (e.g., R).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ones higher on the list of the most popular programming languages are general-purpose languages with a long history (like Java), but there are newer ones on the top 10 list as well, that have been developed for more special purposes (like R and MATLAB).</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we based our list on the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summaries of international trends: </span><a href="https://go.courses/blog/all-the-programming-languages-worth-learning-in-2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go Courses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://medium.com/@satyanageshan8/the-7-most-used-programming-languages-in-2019-and-2020-predictions-29c715c3f456" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">medium.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://hackr.io/blog/best-programming-languages-to-learn-2020-jobs-future" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hackr.io</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stackoverflow Developer Survey</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also looked at job-posting websites to see how many ads contain the programming languages below. In our article, we used the numbers of the website </span><a href="https://hu.indeed.com/jobs?q=java&amp;l=Hungary" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, since that is a meta job-posting site, meaning they compile the jobs from many other job sites. The numbers were accurate during the writing of this article, but job offers always change somewhat, of course.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Java</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Write Once, Run Anywhere”. This is what gives Java its popularity since programs written in this language can be run on any compatible device without recompiling them if Java has been installed. It is a general-purpose language that has versatile uses, like website development, or creating mobile and desktop applications. There are other Java versions available for corporate servers and other business applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also have to mention that Android is Java-based, there are many Java applications for Windows, and the corporate world and back-end programming also build heavily on this language, adding to the wide variety of job options.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 1038 Java-based programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article.</span></p>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Python</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is an easily readable, general-purpose language with an easy syntax. We can recommend this to beginners as well since Python is one of the most suitable programming languages to start learning the basics of programming. It stands on or near the top of the lists of the most popular, the most well-liked by programmers, and the easiest to learn programming languages, and has been on top for years now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine learning and AI development are the fastest developing areas of use for Python. It is also the most often used language in data science, but it isn’t unknown in the world of web programming and game development either.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 740 Python programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article.</span></p>

</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">JavaScript </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is mostly a language of websites. It is used primarily for front-end development, as this language makes most websites more interactive and dynamic, but it is starting to gain popularity on the server-side as well, with the help of the software system Node.js.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All steps of web development, and prior to that, UI and UX design (meaning the creation of user-friendly, good-looking and modern websites) have a great value on the labour market—we always need web developers. You can’t go wrong with this knowledge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 651 JavaScript programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article. </span></p>

</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">One step forward: TypeScript </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TypeScript is a scripting language created by Microsoft. The goal of developing it wasn’t the creation of another rival language, but making a tool that expands the possibilities of JavaScript so that we can do massive projects with it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 172 programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article that requires TypeScript skills or lists them as an advantage.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">C# </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With C#, we can create desktop, mobile, and web-based applications, and with the .NET framework makes it even easier to develop things for tools created by Microsoft and the Windows operating system. This framework has fused together with C# almost completely, they are usually mentioned together, and job offers generally require you to know the framework as well as the language.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are other software development platforms for C#, e.g., Unity, which has been created for game development and has since become the engine for many known games.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C# can also be suitable for writing websites and web applications using the ASP.NET framework.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C# can be used independently from Microsoft—you can write software for Xbox, Android, macOS and many more platforms.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 434 C# programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">SQL</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Structured Query Language is the standard language for data management. In our data-centric world, databases that store and process huge amounts of data are indispensable parts of our tools and services’ background processes. Experts who can create and manage databases like this are in high demand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning SQL is a worthy investment, and if you also have some other programming, data analysis, or data visualization skills, you can have a job basically anywhere since, as we have mentioned before, databases are needed everywhere.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 1300 programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article that requires SQL skills. </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12028 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">C++</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a low-level, close-to-hardware programming language that is hard to read and it is the upgraded version of the widely used C language, which is the basis for many systems. Learning this language requires strong IT and mathematical skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This language usually isn’t recommended for beginners, but this article is about programming languages that can help you find a job, and C++ certainly is one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can be used to create and fine-tune operating systems, device drivers, video games, and even desktop and mobile apps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are not a beginner, or if you are looking for long-term goals, C++ can be an amazing choice since C++ skills are valuable on the labour market. Corporations need highly-trained C++ developers who can complete especially complex and serious programming tasks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This valuable knowledge is compensated with a high salary, and senior C++ developers are among the most well-paid programmers. As newer and newer programming languages start to appear that are easier to use, the number of C++ developers are decreasing, so you are almost guaranteed a job if you are capable of working professionally in this complex language</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 362 C++ programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article.</span></p>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">PHP</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a scripting language used in web development and database management that is relatively easy to learn, and there are good and well-paid opportunities for it from the very beginning. It is popular and in high demand because one of the most popular website creation applications, WordPress, is running in PHP as well. In 2018, 83.5% of websites choose PHP as their server-side programming language, including such tech giants as Facebook, Tumblr or Slack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web developers, and more specifically, back-end or full-stack developers have many job options if they know and use PHP confidently.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 259 PHP programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">R</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">R is a field-specific programming language, used mostly for statistical analyses and the representation of their results. Nowadays, data science is a highly important and dynamically expanding area, so there are many job offers for writing statistical software and data analysis. R also plays a role in machine learning, which is also an important area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since statistical analysis is used in many fields—sciences and human research, commerce, marketing, and meteorology to name a few, R programming skills can be crucial for us not just as members of development teams, but for research groups and other things as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the infinite amount of data we are working within the 21st century, experts in data analysis and exploring correlations are becoming indispensable. So people can be sure that they will find positions in which they can make use of their R skills.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 187 programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article that mentions R.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perl</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previously, the most important language of the web had been Perl, also called “The Duct Tape of the Internet.” Today, other languages have gained considerable ground, but Perl is still a widely used general-purpose language.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They use Perl in system administration, programming networks, creating graphical user interfaces, and, of course, web development is also still on the table.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 129 Perl programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">MATLAB programming language</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lists of most popular programming languages are created using different criteria, but if we are looking at which languages are in high demand on the labour market, MatLab appears on more and more of them. MatLab is both the name of the development environment and the programming language used in that environment. It has been developed mostly for performing technical calculations, developing and testing algorithms, and creating simulations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is often used for a visual representation of scientific test results and data processing tasks. If you already have high mathematical skills or knowledge of some field of science, MatLab can become a valuable asset.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 76 MatLab programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swift </span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swift is a general-purpose, high-level programming language developed by Apple. It can be used to write programs for macOS, iOS or other Apple operating systems. It has many modern features that make development easier and more secure. It stands out from other programming languages for the same purpose in that programs are written in Swift run extremely quickly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The importance of Apple is unquestionable in the world of IT, so even if Swift isn’t one of the most popular programming languages yet, it is quickly rising, and you can already find a lot of jobs if you know it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 75 Swift programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article.</span></p>

<h3><b>What Is Java? </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Java (not to be confused with JavaScript) is a <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/g/generalp.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">general-purpose programming language</a> that was designed to run on a wide variety of devices, ranging from smartphones and PCs to smart TVs. According to the </span><a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stack Overflow Developer Survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Java is the 5th most popular programming language, right below SQL.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12017 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although created back in 1995 by Sun Microsystems, the Java programming language is still popular today. Java is like a simpler version of C++ that takes many design cues from its predecessor, Oak. Java’s slogan, <a href="https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/write-once-run-anywhere-WORA" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">“WORA,”</a> is an acronym that stands for “Write Once, Run Anywhere.” After the code is written in Java, it can run on any compatible device with Java installed without the need for recompilation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h3><b>To show you what Java programming looks like, we’ll use the classic “Hello World” example:</b></h3>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code class="language-java" lang="java">class HelloWorldApp {

    public static void main(String[ ] args) {

        System.out.printIn(“Hello World!”); // Displays the text on the screen. 

    }

}</code></pre>
<h3><strong>What Is Programming in Java Like? </strong></h3>
<p>Java programming is capable of <a class="rank-math-link" href="https://searchapparchitecture.techtarget.com/definition/object-oriented-programming-OOP" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">object-oriented programming,</a> meaning that it allows you to organize attributes together into objects and classes. Once defined in your program, you can reference them at a later time to save you from writing it all out again. A procedural language, on the other hand, requires you to write out huge lines of code that are dependent on each other. Without the convenience of objects, you always have to restate everything. </p>
<h3><strong>Uses for Java</strong></h3>
<p>The great thing about Java programming is that it is extremely versatile and can be found in just about any industry. In fact, once you’ve learned Java, you will never run out of uses and applications for it. The most common uses for Java include web, mobile, and desktop applications. </p>
<h4><em>Mobile</em></h4>
<p>Android applications can be created entirely in Java, meaning that you can become an Android developer with a good knowledge of Java. </p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1275" class="wp-image-8775" src="https://i0.wp.com/codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ux-787980_1920-1.jpg?fit=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1" alt="A Java programozás a legjobb választás mobilapplikációk fejlesztéséhez" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ux-787980_1920-1.jpg 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ux-787980_1920-1-300x199.jpg 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ux-787980_1920-1-1024x680.jpg 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ux-787980_1920-1-768x510.jpg 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ux-787980_1920-1-1536x1020.jpg 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ux-787980_1920-1-1080x717.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>
</div>
<h4><em>Web</em></h4>
<p>Although websites are made up of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, web applications are made up of various different components that can be written in multiple programming languages. Many web applications rely on server code written in Java. Java also supports the creation of Applets, which are small programs, like games, that can be run directly in the browser.</p>
<h4><em>Desktop</em></h4>
<p>In line with its “Write Once, Run Anywhere” philosophy, Java programming can be used to power desktop applications on multiple operating systems, such as Windows, MacOS, and Linux. While Java is not truly native to any platform, there are plenty of tools that allow you to run Java on any operating system. <a class="rank-math-link" href="https://www.oracle.com/java/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Oracle</a>, the company that bought out Sun Microsystems (the creator of Java) offers developer tools for writing Java programs on various platforms.</p>
<h4><em>Enterprise</em></h4>
<p>Not only is Java a programming language, but it’s also a platform. <a class="rank-math-link" href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-ee-glance.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Java EE, or Java Enterprise Edition,</a> is a special version of the Java platform designed for business applications. Java EE is often used for large-scale networks and comes with a higher level of security for corporations. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12018 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><em>Servers</em></h4>
<p>Last, but not least, we have Java for servers. In addition to Java EE, Oracle offers Server JRE, which is a Java platform designed specifically for servers. JRE stands for <a class="rank-math-link" href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5442/java-runtime-environment-jre" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">“Java Runtime Environment”</a>. </p>
<h3><strong><a class="rank-math-link" href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/how-much-can-you-make-as-a-programmer/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">How Much Do Java Programmers Make?</a></strong></h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Java_Developer/Salary" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Payscale</a>, Java programmers based in the U.S. make an average of $72,611. As you might already know, U.S. programmers are some of the best paid in the world. </p>

<p>Even though you may make substantially less in your own country, you’ll still gain incredible earning potential by learning to code in Java—no matter where you live in the world. Java programmers in places like Malaysia, for example, can make up to 1,200% more than the average national salary in their country). Not bad. (See the data here: <a href="https://jobbatical.com/blog/java-developer-salary-by-countries-2017-infographic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Java Developer Salary: Local &amp; Worldwide Comparison Infographic</a>).</p>
<h3><strong>How Do I Learn Java?</strong></h3>
<p>Due to its huge popularity and high demand, there are plenty of online and offline java tutorials available to help you start learning. To find out more, check out our article, “<a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/how-to-learn-to-code/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">How to Learn to Code</a>”.</p>
<h3><strong>How Long Does it Take to Learn Java? </strong></h3>
<p>The amount of time <a class="rank-math-link" href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/how-long-it-takes-to-learn-to-code/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">it takes to learn a programming language</a> depends on the methods you use, your learning retention, and how many hours you invest per week. You can’t expect to know everything about Java programming after taking a semester-long course at your local university or a 14-week program at a coding bootcamp.

<h3><strong>Is Java Right for Me?</strong></h3>
<p>One of the best things about software development is that there is a wide variety of languages out there. If you simply despise programming in Java, for example, there are plenty of alternatives to choose from. Education never really stops. </p>
<p>For most, the basics of Java programming is a good place to start, because it allows you to program for a wide variety of devices and applications with just one single language. </p>
<p>However, if you’re just getting started in programming and are unsure if Java programming is right for you, please check out our article, “<a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/which-programming-language-is-right-for-you/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Which Programming Language Is Right for Me</a>”.</p>
