										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Gábor Baranyi</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">used to work as a personal trainer, and also held training sessions for groups at a gym. Since then, he has found something that fulfils him, and where he can develop continuously: he is working as a junior frontend developer at a medium-sized company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>I live here:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Szeged, Hungary</span></p>
<p><b>I work here:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Minero IT Hungary KFT.</span></p>
<p><b>Time spent studying with CodeBerry</b><b>:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 10 months</span></p>
<p><b>I work with:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Fujitsu Lifebook A555, Windows 7, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntelliJ_IDEA" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">IntelliJ</a>, <a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">SourceTree</a></span></p>
<p><b>When you’re asked about your profession, how do you answer?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It depends on who’s asking.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If it is a professional in the field, I say a frontend developer. If it is a layperson showing some interest, my answer is that I am a programmer or software developer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>What did you do for a living before you switched to web development?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I used to work full time as a personal trainer and held group training sessions at a functional gym. I still offer these group sessions, in addition to working as a programmer.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><b>Why did you decide to start learning web development?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">always been interested in web design, in how and why a website looks as it does. Besides that, the gym&#8217;s webpage was partly managed by us, trainers, so I spent a lot of time writing and designing our WordPress blog, which I really enjoyed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I spotted a good opportunity on Facebook, where they advertised an online web develop</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> course. I looked it up, and I knew that I have to master the ins and outs of this profession on this platform&#8230; or at least the basics of it. It was the advertisement of CodeBerry.</span></p>
<p><b>How did you learn programming? What kind of courses, books etc. did you use?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After seeing the above-mentioned advertisement, I started to study at CodeBerry&#8217;s online course in September 2016, and later I added Codecademy and Udemy courses to my learning resources as well. I searched for and learned specific programming languages on video sharing sites.</span></p>
<p><b>What did CodeBerry offer you? What was it like to study at our school?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was very useful. I really liked your monthly subscription system, because this way I could study at my own pace. I loved the explanations, the examples through which the tasks are presented.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-6606 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Gabor_Baranyi_pic1.jpeg" alt="This is how a frontend developer’s desk looks like" width="760" height="427" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Gabor_Baranyi_pic1.jpeg 760w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Gabor_Baranyi_pic1-300x169.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gábor’s Desk</span></p>
<p><b>Do you have any experience, tips or tricks to share with those who are just starting their studies?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I find it very important to learn the basics well and to revise the earlier lessons to see the connections </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and to be able to put the new material in context. Revision is crucial.</span></p>
<p><b>Tell me a little about where you work now, what your duties are. What do you do on a typical day or week?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, I work at a Budapest based company&#8217;s office in Szeged. We are developing an internal project where I deal with the frontend, consisting of <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/a-brief-introduction-to-web-development/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I arrive at the office around 8 a.m. and I leave at 5 p.m. I try to do something different when I am not there; training or holding group training, so I can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">face the next working day energized and refreshed.</span></p>
<p><b>Who do you work with, and how do they help your work?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are currently about 20 people working in the office. I have a mentor helping me with my progress, who also supervises the project we are working on.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12018 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><b>What kind of software, tools or technologies do you work with currently?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The development environment is IntelliJ, for version control we use SourceTree and for repo, we use BitBucket.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the project, we use HTML, CSS (SCSS), jQuery, Angular JS, Angular Material and FUSE.</span></p>
<p><b>How long were you looking for a job? Was it hard to find a place to work?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actually, I was still studying when my friend suggest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ed that I s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">end my CV to the company he works for. They invited me for an int</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">erview, and a few weeks later they called me saying that they would like to work with me, based on my performance.</span></p>
<p><b>How was the interview process?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a brief introduction of the company, the interview continued in English, and it was my turn to introduce myself, talk a bit about my private life and about how and where I learned programming, also in English.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was followed by a technical part, where they assessed my knowledge and gave me a few logic tests to solve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The whole interview took about an hour.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12255 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><b>Do you have any advice for those who are currently preparing for a job interview?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is very important that everything you say has to be positive. Even if something negative comes up, try to talk about it from a positive aspect or perspective. Always stay confident, and show that you are able and willing to improve in any field.</span></p>
<p><b>What is the next step for you? What direction are you taking?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want to know as much about frontend development as possible and get a taste of backend development as well to see and understand the whole background process.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>János Farkas</strong> is a construction technician, an applied graphic artist and a baker by profession.<br />
He has been working as a junior frontend developer at Y-collective (a Hungarian company) since January.</p>
<p><strong>In this episode of <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/category/codeberry-student-stories/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Student Stories</a>, let us take you on a follow-up journey</strong> with a former CodeBerry Programming School student.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I live here</strong>: Pécs, Hungary</p>
<p><strong>I work here</strong>: <a href="https://y-collective.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Y-collective</a></p>
<p><strong>I studied at CodeBerry for this long</strong>: 2 months</p>
<p><strong>I use</strong>: PHPStorm, Stack Overflow, CSS-tricks, W3Schools</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>When you&#8217;re asked about your profession, how do you answer?</strong></h3>
<p>First of all, I say that I am a programmer, usually everyone understands this.<br />
In most cases, people are interested when I tell them my profession. So, I give more details by explaining that I prepare the user interface of web pages visible to users.<br />
Sometimes I work on server-side scripting too&#8230;</p>
<h3><strong>What did you do for a living before you switched to web development?</strong></h3>
<p>This is the first time I work as a website developer. However, I started to get familiar with this field much earlier.<br />
I&#8217;ve been interested in this field for the past 10 years, but I only started taking it seriously last year.<br />
So far I only created some smaller websites (and I would do these in a different way now <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ).<br />
As for my previous jobs, I worked in the trading sector for 10 years.<br />
As the manager of the bakery department of a 7000 square meter superstore, my task was to supervise production, procurement, schedules and anything related.<br />
So, it was quite a big change for me.</p>

<h3><strong>Why did you decide to start studying web development?</strong></h3>
<p>I have always been fascinated by the software part of computer science.<br />
Each year, the internet and web-related technologies play a greater and greater role in our everyday life.<br />
This results in an urging need for more and more professional developers. I would like to take this chance. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h3><strong>Tell me a little about where you work now, what your duties are. What do you do on a typical day or week?</strong></h3>
<p>I work as a junior site builder at Y-collective. Our office is in downtown Pécs.<br />
At the beginning of the week, there is a project management meeting where the tasks are determined and assigned. So it is more or less clear what everyone is going to work on during the week and maybe the following week.<br />
We have a lot of projects, so we have quite a variety of tasks.<br />
And it may happen that some urgent matter or a bug comes up on an ad hoc basis.<br />
My days usually start around 6 a.m., with a coffee.<br />
While drinking it, I glance over the news or I read about something I was dealing with the previous day.<br />
I usually go to work by bike. The official working hours are from eight in the morning to four in the afternoon, plus at times I stay a half-hour or an hour longer.<br />
Besides developments we do changes, bug fixes, importing existing modules to other projects, administrative duties, database modification&#8230;<br />
We recently started to concentrate more on unique WordPress developments.<br />
At times it needs some research or a plugin change, so it&#8217;s not boring.<br />
What I use daily is PHP, HTML, CSS, SCSS/LESS, Javascript/jQuery, Node/Bower, Bootstrap, and git.<br />
There are weekly/biweekly internal training and meetups on some subject.</p>

<h3><strong>How long were you looking for a job? Was it hard to find a place to work?</strong></h3>
<p>After all, I wasn&#8217;t looking for a job for long. Or rather, I did not expect to be able to enter the world of IT within such a short period of time.<br />
<a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/im-adam-freisinger-the-founder-of-codeberry-and-this-is-how-i-work/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Adam Freisinger</a>, one of the mentors at CodeBerry asked me about my professional goals, as I was making good progress with the materials.<br />
I didn&#8217;t keep it a secret that I intended to work in this field, so he organized an interview for me, then I got a trial task, and later a job.<br />
Hereby I&#8217;d like to thank everyone for the support, I&#8217;ll do my best to make up for it <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h3><strong>How did you learn programming? What kind of courses, books etc. did you use?</strong></h3>
<p>At first, I researched online materials, read articles and did tutorials.<br />
Then there was even more self-studying and then the next step was CodeBerry.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12018 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>What did CodeBerry offer you? What was it like to study at our school?</strong></h3>
<p>I was looking for an online course that could help me get to the next level. But for various reasons, none of them seemed really good.<br />
Then I stumbled upon CodeBerry.<br />
I really liked the approach: they not only realized that individuals need this course, but also that the IT sector is in need of junior professionals.<br />
A symbiotic relationship is built from this approach, which serves everyone&#8217;s needs.<br />
Studying is completely personalized: everyone can progress at their own pace. If someone is stuck, help is available from the Slack community, and Amanda.<br />
I wouldn&#8217;t say that I found very many new pieces of information in the teaching material, but for me, it was very useful for revising, for filling in the gaps I had, for deepening my knowledge&#8230;<br />
Personally, the extra service CodeBerry provided me was that I could assess my knowledge quite well, so I was more confident to make the decision to try myself out.</p>
<h3><strong>Do you have any experience, tips or tricks to share with those who are just starting their studies?</strong></h3>
<p>Start a side project while studying. Give a solution to a real problem, no matter how small it may be.<br />
You can learn a lot this way.<br />
Feel free to copy a solution or parts of it, but plan your own version and analyze and understand the parts that are not obvious to you.<br />
Even the scope of your studies can be built on this.</p>

<h3><strong>What is the next step for you? What direction are you taking?</strong></h3>
<p>First of all, I definitely want to deepen my knowledge and catch up with my colleagues.<br />
We have a very well-prepared and seasoned team. Everyone is really good at what they do, and I learn a lot from them every day.<br />
Then I want to reach my own limits, and then&#8230; we&#8217;ll see.</p>
