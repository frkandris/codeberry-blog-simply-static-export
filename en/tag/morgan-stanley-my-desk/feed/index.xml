										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>BalÃ¡zs Gergely SoÃ³s</strong>, BeeGee is a graduate computer science engineer with a PhD from the PPKE Multidisciplinary Doctoral School of Sciences and Technology, also an alumni member of the BME SchÃ¶nherz College &#8211; and now also a student of <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">CodeBerry</a>. He formerly worked for SZTAKI as a research assistant, was a research engineer at Searchlab, senior developer and founder of Streamnovation and leader programmer at Zinemath.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I live here</strong>: Budapest, Hungary</p>
<p><strong>I work here</strong>: MorganStanley</p>
<p><strong>Time spent studying with <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">CodeBerry</a></strong>: 3 months</p>
<p><strong>I work with</strong>:HP ENVY, Samsung Galaxy S4 mini, Chrome, <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Notepad++</a>, <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/gitk" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">gitk</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h4>When you&#8217;re asked about your profession, how do you answer?</h4>
<p>Iâ€™m a software developer.</p>
<h4>What was your job before you started coding? Did you have any former experience in this field?</h4>
<p>When I was a child I used to look for swapped Oâ€™s and zeros in BASIC programs. I gave up an aircraft modelling workshop to draw with a Commodore+4 and I was often fiddling with GV-Basic (C64) too. I used Tubo Pascal in high school and <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/beginners-guide-to-c/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">C++</a> at university among other interesting languages. <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/beginners-guide-to-c/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">C++</a> stuck with me for quite a long timeâ€¦ and then machine vision, robotics and GPU programming came along.</p>
<h4>Why did you decide to start learning web development?</h4>
<p>In my opinion desktop applications are done for. Instead, I was interested in mobile development and cloud services. I wanted to learn WebGL after coming across it for the first time. I thought the first step should be recalling my web knowledge, as I had previously dealt with some <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/beginners-guide-to-php/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">PHP</a> and MySQL, but the frontend was always done by someone else. Many of my projects focused on calculation, not the interface. However, I became curious about the tricks done by <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/g/gui.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">GUI wizards</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h4>Please tell us more about what you do now, what tasks you have? What happens on a typical day?</h4>
<p>I work in a bank, so thatâ€™s a secret. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> But my job includes some daily frontend tasks.</p>
<h4>How long were you looking for a job? How did you land your current position?</h4>
<p>My previous one was like a dream job: a real dreamer mastermind, fantastic engineers, international exhibitions and a rock-solid investor. But one day I felt like it was all too much. I needed some peace and quiet to be able to hear some new voices and finally have time for my family and myself.</p>
<p>This impulse hit me in the summer. My wife had 4 weeks off, so we moved to Venice for the time. Relaxing by the lakeside made me realise how much Iâ€™m missing some intellectual activity, so I started studyingâ€¦</p>
<p>Two months later I had a couple of interviews. When the news of me not working got around, one of my dorm fellows called me and said if I still love those special program languages and Iâ€™m interested in big databases, then he has an empty desk for me by his sideâ€¦</p>
<h4>How did you learn programming? What kind of courses, books etc. did you use?</h4>
<p>I donâ€™t remember anymore, it just happened. I possessed a few issues with Computerbooks. The next thing was university: GyÃ¶rgy Pongor and ZoltÃ¡n LÃ¡szlÃ³. After that, I kept to online materials.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8548" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/home-office-336373_1920-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="As a Codeberry student you can learn everywhere" width="1024" height="683" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/home-office-336373_1920-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/home-office-336373_1920-1-300x200.jpg 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/home-office-336373_1920-1-768x512.jpg 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/home-office-336373_1920-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/home-office-336373_1920-1-1080x720.jpg 1080w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/home-office-336373_1920-1.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h4>&#8220;What did CodeBerry offer you? What was it like to study at our school?</h4>
<p>I read about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Node.js</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_(web_framework)" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Angular</a> and could feel the power of their combination. During my doctorate years, I fell in love with independent research, the joy of discovering something new. On the other hand, I do respect teachers who gave me a good kickstart before the journey. Learning out of blogs is really like being in a big city without a map: there are dozens of buses, many tramlines and a few undergrounds. Sometimes you need help with the directions if you actually want to get somewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/andras-p-toth-serial-entrepreneur/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Andris</a> and I meet each other every month. He told me about CodeBerry when it was just a twinkle in his eye. Later <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/web-development-story-of-arpad-binecz/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Bini</a> said he likes the idea. I thought: why not? I was probably one of the first twenty applicants. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Before it wasnâ€™t my job to make something pretty. At the beginning of the lessons, the focus was on the frontend. I didnâ€™t regret that though. It was very useful to be able to try everything I just learned and test my knowledge with quizzes. By the time I completed a WordPress site, CSS and I became great friends.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12255 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h4>Do you have any experience, tips or tricks to share with those who are just starting their studies?</h4>
<p>You just have to sit down and do itâ€¦ I got the final push from a friend of mine: he asked me to create a responsive website for him. He took advantage of me not working at the time. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h4>What is the next step for you? What direction are you taking?</h4>
<p>As soon as I&#8217;ll have a few spare weekends, I&#8217;ll steer back to my original goal, WebGL. Maybe Spiced up with some VR.</p>
