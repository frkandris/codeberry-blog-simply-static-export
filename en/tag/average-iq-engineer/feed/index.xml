										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>D√°vid Veszelovszki</strong> started coding at the age of six and a half, and he‚Äôs been working as a developer since he turned 16. His hobby is travelling. Four years ago, he spent a brief one and a half years exploring Asia and Australia. Now he‚Äôs ‚Äúgone‚Äù for another six months‚Äîdriving around the USA in a red car, accompanied by his girlfriend.</p>

</blockquote>
<h4>When you&#8217;re asked about your profession, how do you answer?</h4>
<p>I&#8217;m a travelling Humanities Engineer.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h4>Tell me more about what program you‚Äôre developing right now?</h4>
<p>Currently, I‚Äôm on vacation, so the answer is nothing. The last thing I‚Äôve worked on was the learning interface of CodeBerry, the virtual ‚Äúclassroom‚Äù where students receive their homework. I also have some hobby projects, like the mobile app I developed last to read my old movie critics with. It came in very handy. I still use it regularly.</p>
<h4>How does your workspace look like?</h4>
<p>I didn‚Äôt find a picture of my desk, but here‚Äôs what my home workspace looks like:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-5820" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/David_Veszelovszki_pic1-3.jpeg" alt=" Engineers at work" width="789" height="442" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The founders of CodeBerry (left to right: D√°vid Veszelovszki, √Åd√°m Freisinger, Andr√°s P. T√≥th, L√°szl√≥ B√©k√©ssy)</p>
<h4>When, where, and how did you learn to code?</h4>
<p>I got a 286 PC and a Quick Basic book from my father when I was six; I learned the basics from that. My dad helped me out whenever I got stuck.</p>
<h4>What are the job opportunities for web developers? On average, how much time did you spend looking for a job?</h4>
<p>The opportunities are really great. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever even looked for a full-time job before because something always found me before I had time to search. I usually look for projects, it only takes me a few hours.</p>
<h4>What is your daily, weekly, etc. schedule like?</h4>
<p><strong>My day:</strong> We get up at 8 in the car, eat a Subway sandwich or some fruits for breakfast, brush our teeth, and head somewhere by car or by foot. We look around, take some pictures, cook lunch in the car, and then continue walking or driving and taking pictures. We spend the evening by reading, watching a movie or something alike, and then go to sleep. It doesn‚Äôt sound like a packed day but it is. We walk 10k+ steps and I drive ~100 miles each day.</p>
<p><strong>My week</strong>: We work out approximately 5 times a week (and take showers! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ). Once a week I sit down for an hour or two to review the past week and plan the next. Twice or three times a week, we eat some local specialities depending on where we are at the time.</p>
<p><strong>My month</strong>: My past two months were very different from the rest. At the moment, we just keep repeating the things I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p><strong>My year</strong>: Luckily, each year is different. I like the changes. I started 2016 with intensive studying and later we started working on CodeBerry and that took all my time. I then hit the road in July.</p>

<h4></h4>
<h4>What surprised you about this job that you never thought of before?</h4>
<p>Well, this was a long time ago, but I was surprised I could make new games for myself and set new tasks one after another. It‚Äôs just like LEGO but with infinite building blocks from the start. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h4>Do you have skills that would surprise everyday people?</h4>
<p>Meditating 10 hours every day for 10 days in a row. I <a href="https://www.dhamma.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">learned</a> this back in 2011 in India, but you can learn it anywhere else for free.</p>
<h4>Who do you work with?</h4>
<p>With my girlfriend, D√≥ri. We travel together; that‚Äôs my current ‚Äújob‚Äù. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h4>What are the typical career paths in your profession?</h4>
<p>Well, if my profession is IT, then the most popular path is to attend university at age 18-24, work 40 years in various places, spend 2-7 years in each place, and retire.<br />
A more unusual way of life‚Äîthe one I‚Äôd like to follow‚Äîis to spend less than I make and retire earlier. (Spending all my money while travelling doesn‚Äôt really help though. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> )</p>
<h4>What are your plans and how do you wish to continue?</h4>
<p>I‚Äôd like to continue working on CodeBerry for a few years. Afterwards, I‚Äôll probably find a similar enterprise because I like entrepreneurship. I usually organize my life around helping people. I want to help them learn a lot in a small amount of time and live a healthy life.</p>
<h4>What other profession would you choose if you had to change? Could you change?</h4>
<p>I‚Äôd be glad to work next to a conveyor belt because that‚Äôs meditative. Or I‚Äôd be part of the cleaning staff to enter places locked away from others. Or a cashier in a local supermarket so that there would be at least one nice cashier in that shop. Or a high school teacher, teaching any subject. Or a carpenter‚Äîthat must be really cool!<br />
I think I‚Äôd be able to do any of those, but programming pays more so I won‚Äôt change.</p>
<h4>What skills do great developers, IT experts require? Who do you not recommend this profession to?</h4>
<p>Structured thinking, monotony tolerance and higher than average IQ are required. I don‚Äôt recommend it to those who don‚Äôt have these qualities or are not interested in IT.</p>
<h4>What‚Äôs your favourite part?</h4>
<p>That I can create great value in very little time. And that people appreciate my job. Also, I can work from anywhere.</p>
<h4>What grinds your gears most? What are the difficulties and dangers of your profession?</h4>
<p>The most difficult part is to keep a lot of information in mind all at once. The annoying part is when you don‚Äôt have proper tools, e.g. the application you have to use is uncomfortable. The biggest danger is sitting a lot in front of the computer because you can become fat and unhealthy.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12255 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h4></h4>
<h4>How stable is your job? How much time does one spend working for the same company?</h4>
<p>My main job is travelling at the moment. It‚Äôs pretty stable for the next four months, but we‚Äôll be heading home shortly after that.</p>
<h4>If you had to ask one thing in the name of all developers, what would it be?</h4>
<p>I would ask why don‚Äôt more people want to do this. It‚Äôs so cool! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h4>How much can one earn in this profession (as a newbie, experienced and veteran)?</h4>
<p>In [the US] it‚Äôs average [$60k/90k/120k] per [year] as a software developer.</p>
<h4>What do you think is the best way to learn to code?</h4>
<p>Actively and passionately, with the help of free courses, e.g. <a href="http://freecodecamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">freecodecamp</a>. Or if one doesn‚Äôt speak very good English, there‚Äôs CodeBerry.</p>
<h4>What makes code worth learning?</h4>
<p>If this profession suits you, it‚Äôs a challenging and creative job. By the end of the day, you can go to sleep thinking you‚Äôve created something yet again.</p>
