<li><strong>How to find the right beginner programming course for you?</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>Before you begin—Step 0</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve been considering getting to know the world of coding, you may want to get an idea of the available options for learning the basics first. To be able to choose from the various courses in the market, you have to know what you can expect from different introductory, junior programmer, and developer courses. That is what we were trying to help you with by compiling this summary.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12017 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h2>Changing career, returning to the labor market with kids, or finding programming courses for kids?</h2>
<h3>There is a course for you, whatever your situation may be</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The structure of the training courses mostly depends on the target group they are designed for. Programs aimed at children, high school students, people wanting to change careers or mothers trying to return to the labor market are paced differently and use different methodologies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Younger students can practice the basics of analytical thinking and programming in a fun way. Mothers can join training programs that accommodate their lifestyle while they have small children: these programs organize child care services next to the classroom and adjust the schedule so that it supports family life, helping them develop a new routine allowing mothers to learn a new profession.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those wanting to study while also working or in university can choose from part-time courses. Others might want to get the skills necessary to start building their career in IT sooner, in a matter of months or even weeks. For them, bootcamps will be the perfect option: although these require 8–10 hours spent on studying daily, which is the equivalent of a full-time job, they offer a super fast-paced learning experience.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the structure of a course does not necessarily depend on the target audience entirely. Some technologies simply cannot be learned with a few months’ intensive training. The next part of the article will talk about technologies and some other factors affecting the available selection of courses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the courses available for various target groups</span></p>

<h2>What would you like to do in the future; what job can you see yourself doing?</h2>
<h3>Your choice of technology should depend on this</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Various fields and positions in IT require knowledge of different technologies. In order to choose the right programming language to learn, you should figure out what you want to do exactly in the early stages of planning your new career. Full-stack web developers need an entirely different set of skills than what is required for developing games or working with artificial intelligence. Different career paths come with different working conditions and different salary ranges, and the programming languages you need to learn will always depend on which direction you want to take. As a programmer, you can be a freelancer, launch your own project, or work as an employee of a small start-up or a multinational company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’d like to work at a big company with a secure background, you might need more complex programming knowledge. Completing a Java programming course</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">will give you valuable skills that can be used in countless areas, while learning the highly complex C++ programming language (which is definitely not recommended for beginners) will make you a very valuable employee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are android programming courses especially designed for creating mobile applications, and you can get into various areas of web development through front-end and back-end technologies. A solid grasp and application of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript languages alone can be enough for building sophisticated and substantial web pages, but for delving into data science, you will want to opt for languages such as R or Python. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We could go on, but the point has been made: start in the direction that will take you to your chosen destination. </span></p>
<h2>Course length, schedule, pace and mentoring</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we have mentioned at the beginning of the article, programming schools offer courses of various lengths: a few weeks, months, or even a couple of years. The length of a course depends on the volume of the learning material and the course schedule.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Courses that can be completed within a few weeks mostly function as an introduction to the world of coding; they help you decide whether this path is right for you and which direction to take. Super intensive courses, or bootcamps, usually take up your whole day, and they give you the capabilities necessary for starting a new career, a complex set of web development skills for example, within a few months. Other programming courses take up only a couple of hours of your time every week, but they will last for many months and you will probably have to do homework too.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another significant factor to consider is whether it is an online course, or one held offline, in a real classroom. The benefit of on-campus training is that you can work together with the student community in real time and space, it can give you external motivation and reassurance, and you can use the professional equipment and technology installed there.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12028 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Online courses vary in their schedule, which can be set as remote teaching with a fixed class schedule and group work, or it could let students progress at their own pace entirely. Choosing this option has the benefit of being able to study anywhere, usually with a partially or fully flexible schedule, at your own pace. Having the option to set your own schedule is great, but it needs serious perseverance and some self-discipline to make the most of it. Of course, these are also important if you progress together with a school or community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your progress will be guided by a mentor most often, but various schools have different solutions in this regard. There could be a single mentor for a whole group of students, or mentors could be assigned to each student individually. A rather common approach is to let the students progress on their own, with the option of asking questions and getting answers from a mentor anytime. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If mentoring is not part of the given course, you might still be able to ask questions and support each other in a virtual student community. Of course, there are also curriculums that you will have to learn all by yourself. </span></p>
<h2>The role of practice in the learning process</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like any new skill you learn, programming needs a lot of practice before you can use it confidently. Not every course incorporates the same amount of theory and practical exercises in its curriculum. Some schools focus on creating a project together, where you can learn your new skills by working through each stage of the project. Others let you code on your own to create a website, application, game, etc. There are even courses using agile methods, coaching, and teamwork to simulate a corporate environment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certain programming schools arrange apprenticeships for their graduated students at partner companies, so that they can deepen their knowledge as paid interns.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12019 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h2>Programming schools with job guarantee? Prepaid or postpaid options?</h2>
<h3>A short note on payment structures</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many programming schools now offer to support you in finding a job, and some provide a full job guarantee. That means that if you cannot find a suitable job within a certain time period after completing the course, you get a refund, or in case of postpaid courses, you don’t have to pay the tuition fee. If your job hunt is successful, you can pay the course fees from the salary you earn as a programmer in the postpaid system. There is a wide range of coding courses in terms of fees and payment options, including free programming courses, state-funded education, and various scholarships.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see, there are many options to choose from—you just need to find the one that’s best for you. The multitude of available courses might seem a little overwhelming now, but don’t panic: all you need is a little planning, self-awareness and research to get one step closer to making the right decision about where you should start learning to code. </span></p>

<h3><b>What Is Java? </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Java (not to be confused with JavaScript) is a <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/g/generalp.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">general-purpose programming language</a> that was designed to run on a wide variety of devices, ranging from smartphones and PCs to smart TVs. According to the </span><a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stack Overflow Developer Survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Java is the 5th most popular programming language, right below SQL.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12017 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although created back in 1995 by Sun Microsystems, the Java programming language is still popular today. Java is like a simpler version of C++ that takes many design cues from its predecessor, Oak. Java’s slogan, <a href="https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/write-once-run-anywhere-WORA" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">“WORA,”</a> is an acronym that stands for “Write Once, Run Anywhere.” After the code is written in Java, it can run on any compatible device with Java installed without the need for recompilation.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_8777" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8777" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-8777" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/concept-2791440_1920-1024x540.jpg" alt="With a good idea and some Java knowledge you can create amazing things in short time" width="1024" height="540" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/concept-2791440_1920-1024x540.jpg 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/concept-2791440_1920-300x158.jpg 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/concept-2791440_1920-768x405.jpg 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/concept-2791440_1920-1536x810.jpg 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/concept-2791440_1920-1080x570.jpg 1080w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/concept-2791440_1920.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-8777" class="wp-caption-text">With a good idea and some Java knowledge you can create amazing things in a short time</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h3><b>To show you what Java programming looks like, we’ll use the classic “Hello World” example:</b></h3>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code class="language-java" lang="java">class HelloWorldApp {

    public static void main(String[ ] args) {

        System.out.printIn(“Hello World!”); // Displays the text on the screen. 

    }

}</code></pre>
<h3><strong>What Is Programming in Java Like? </strong></h3>
<p>Java programming is capable of <a class="rank-math-link" href="https://searchapparchitecture.techtarget.com/definition/object-oriented-programming-OOP" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">object-oriented programming,</a> meaning that it allows you to organize attributes together into objects and classes. Once defined in your program, you can reference them at a later time to save you from writing it all out again. A procedural language, on the other hand, requires you to write out huge lines of code that are dependent on each other. Without the convenience of objects, you always have to restate everything. </p>
<h3><strong>Uses for Java</strong></h3>
<p>The great thing about Java programming is that it is extremely versatile and can be found in just about any industry. In fact, once you’ve learned Java, you will never run out of uses and applications for it. The most common uses for Java include web, mobile, and desktop applications. </p>
<h4><em>Mobile</em></h4>
<p>Android applications can be created entirely in Java, meaning that you can become an Android developer with a good knowledge of Java. </p>

</div>
<h4><em>Web</em></h4>
<p>Although websites are made up of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, web applications are made up of various different components that can be written in multiple programming languages. Many web applications rely on server code written in Java. Java also supports the creation of Applets, which are small programs, like games, that can be run directly in the browser.</p>
<h4><em>Desktop</em></h4>
<p>In line with its “Write Once, Run Anywhere” philosophy, Java programming can be used to power desktop applications on multiple operating systems, such as Windows, MacOS, and Linux. While Java is not truly native to any platform, there are plenty of tools that allow you to run Java on any operating system. <a class="rank-math-link" href="https://www.oracle.com/java/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Oracle</a>, the company that bought out Sun Microsystems (the creator of Java) offers developer tools for writing Java programs on various platforms.</p>
<h4><em>Enterprise</em></h4>
<p>Not only is Java a programming language, but it’s also a platform. <a class="rank-math-link" href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-ee-glance.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Java EE, or Java Enterprise Edition,</a> is a special version of the Java platform designed for business applications. Java EE is often used for large-scale networks and comes with a higher level of security for corporations. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12018 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><em>Servers</em></h4>
<p>Last, but not least, we have Java for servers. In addition to Java EE, Oracle offers Server JRE, which is a Java platform designed specifically for servers. JRE stands for <a class="rank-math-link" href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5442/java-runtime-environment-jre" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">“Java Runtime Environment”</a>. </p>
<h3><strong><a class="rank-math-link" href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/how-much-can-you-make-as-a-programmer/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">How Much Do Java Programmers Make?</a></strong></h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Java_Developer/Salary" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Payscale</a>, Java programmers based in the U.S. make an average of $72,611. As you might already know, U.S. programmers are some of the best paid in the world. </p>

<p>Even though you may make substantially less in your own country, you’ll still gain incredible earning potential by learning to code in Java—no matter where you live in the world. Java programmers in places like Malaysia, for example, can make up to 1,200% more than the average national salary in their country). Not bad. (See the data here: <a href="https://jobbatical.com/blog/java-developer-salary-by-countries-2017-infographic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Java Developer Salary: Local &amp; Worldwide Comparison Infographic</a>).</p>
<h3><strong>How Do I Learn Java?</strong></h3>
<p>Due to its huge popularity and high demand, there are plenty of online and offline java tutorials available to help you start learning. To find out more, check out our article, “<a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/how-to-learn-to-code/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">How to Learn to Code</a>”.</p>
<h3><strong>How Long Does it Take to Learn Java? </strong></h3>
<p>The amount of time <a class="rank-math-link" href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/how-long-it-takes-to-learn-to-code/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">it takes to learn a programming language</a> depends on the methods you use, your learning retention, and how many hours you invest per week. You can’t expect to know everything about Java programming after taking a semester-long course at your local university or a 14-week program at a coding bootcamp. However, depending on your dedication, the basics you need to develop a good foundation can be learned rather quickly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Is Java Right for Me?</strong></h3>
<p>One of the best things about software development is that there is a wide variety of languages out there. If you simply despise programming in Java, for example, there are plenty of alternatives to choose from. Education never really stops. </p>
<p>For most, the basics of Java programming is a good place to start, because it allows you to program for a wide variety of devices and applications with just one single language. </p>
<p>However, if you’re just getting started in programming and are unsure if Java programming is right for you, please check out our article, “<a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/which-programming-language-is-right-for-you/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Which Programming Language Is Right for Me</a>”.</p>
