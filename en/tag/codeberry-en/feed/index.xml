</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ve read the articles, searched the web, and done all the research you can on programming. Now, it’s time to finally make the big decision: “what programming language should I learn?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great question. Fortunately for you, we have a step-by-step guide that will help you decide what your motivation is for learning to code and which programming languages you should then learn.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12123 alignright" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/1-683x1024.png" alt="" width="304" height="456" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/1-683x1024.png 683w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/1-200x300.png 200w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/1-768x1152.png 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/1.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 304px) 100vw, 304px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you’re still in the searching stage, this guide should give you some clarity regarding the purpose of the most common programming languages and your preferred niche. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve also identified four distinct ways to rank the top programming languages: by </span><b>popularity</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b>ease-of-learning, earning potential</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><b>usefulness</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disclaimer: In this article, we’ve grouped markup languages, such as HTML and CSS, and scripting languages, such as Bash/Shell and SQL, into the category of programming languages.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start with a list of the top ten most popular programming languages according to <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">StackOverflow</a>:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this list, we see JavaScript, HTML, and CSS taking the top 3 spots for the most popular programming languages. These three languages are the backbone of front-end web development and serve as a great starting point for beginners. SQL is used for database management and the rest, such as Java, Python, C#, PHP, and C++, are general-purpose languages that you can use for a variety of tasks. Bash/Shell, on the other hand, is a command language used to communicate with Unix-based operating systems, like Linux and macOS.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12017 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What about the easiest languages to learn? </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12124 alignleft" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/3-683x1024.png" alt="" width="300" height="450" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/3-683x1024.png 683w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/3-200x300.png 200w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/3-768x1152.png 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/3.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, many of the most popular programming languages are also the easiest to learn. However, we also find some more obscure programming languages, such as R and Erlang. R is a coding language designed for statistical computing and mathematics and is a great tool for data analysis (which we’ll discuss later in the article). Erlang is primarily used for telecommunication and is present in many messaging applications, such as WhatsApp.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;and the top-paying programming languages? </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12125 alignright" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/5-683x1024.png" alt="" width="314" height="471" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/5-683x1024.png 683w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/5-200x300.png 200w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/5-768x1152.png 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/5.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re new to programming, you probably didn’t recognize many of the languages on this list. Since computer programming is a rapidly evolving industry, the highest-paid skills tend to be related to the newest, most cutting edge technologies. However, knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is enough to get you started in your career—other languages can wait. </span></p>
<h2><b>Overview</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides salary, popularity, and ease of learning, you probably have your own personal motivations to learn a specific programming language. In the area below, we’ll examine some of the determining factors that might help you decide on a programming language and what uses they have. </span></p>
<h2><b>Choosing a Language by Usefulness</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where things get a bit more complicated. How “useful” a language is to you will depend on what you’d like to accomplish with code. For example, HTML and CSS might be extremely useful to a front-end web developer, while Swift and Java are more useful to a mobile developer. Some programming languages, like Python, are designed for general purpose use, but many others are specialized tools that will help you complete specific tasks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, let’s determine why you want to learn to code, decide what area you’d like to focus on, and then find the programming language that is right for you:</span></p>
<h2><b>I Want to Be a Professional Developer</b></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Game Developer</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re passionate about becoming a game developer, there are two main programming languages that you’ll have to master: C++ and C#. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’d like to develop fun, 2D mobile games that are based on community and online interaction, C# is definitely the choice for you. C# is easier to learn and less complicated than C++, making it the main programming language of indie and mobile games. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C++, on the other hand, delivers incredible power and can be used for 3D mobile games and “AAA” titles for PC and console. To create video games with the best performance and the most beautiful graphics, C++ is the way to go. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web Developer</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our article, “<a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/a-brief-introduction-to-programming/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">A Brief Introduction to Programming</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we talked a lot about the big three programming languages for web development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML handles the format, CSS determines the style, and JavaScript makes the page come alive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For web developers who focus primarily on UX (user experience), HTML5 and JavaScript are their most commonly used tools. Web developers involved in e-commerce, however, shift their focus to more advanced languages, such as Java, Ruby, Python, PHP, and C#. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web programmers for small businesses will probably use PHP, while programmers for recent startups use Java, Ruby, and JavaScript for most of their work. Enterprise web developers tend to use C# and Java more often for bigger, Windows-based applications. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile Developer</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile development is a bit more straightforward and only requires you to know one programming language per operating system. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6957" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rami-al-zayat-170349-unsplash-1.jpg" alt="" width="5184" height="3456" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rami-al-zayat-170349-unsplash-1.jpg 5184w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rami-al-zayat-170349-unsplash-1-300x200.jpg 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rami-al-zayat-170349-unsplash-1-768x512.jpg 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rami-al-zayat-170349-unsplash-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rami-al-zayat-170349-unsplash-1-1080x720.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 5184px) 100vw, 5184px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to create mobile apps for the iPhone or iPad, all you need to know is Swift, Apple’s own programming language for iOS. Introduced in 2014, Swift is a very powerful language that was designed to allow you to program nearly any Apple device. With knowledge of Swift, you can also write applications for Mac, the Apple Watch, and Apple TV!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile development for Android has taken off in recent years and has grown to surpass the popularity of development for iOS. Android is based on Java, making it super easy to learn if you already have experience using the language. You can also go from developing apps for Android to doing a ton of other cool things after you’ve gained the experience in Java. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last, but not least, we come to the Windows phone. The Windows mobile OS runs on C#, one of Microsoft’s very own programming languages. Coding in C# is an extremely valuable skill that any Windows developer should know. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, we are seeing the lines begin to blur as both mobile and desktop become more unified. Rather than being separated by mobile and desktop, programming languages are instead segregated by the ecosystem (Microsoft, Google, and Apple). Google even developed their own language called “Go”, which we might see in the future as a replacement for Java in Android. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Desktop Software</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we mentioned above, the same programming languages that you’ll need for mobile development can be used to develop desktop software as well. If you’re interested in developing software for Windows platforms, you’ll want to learn C#. To develop cross-platform software and programs for Mac, you should learn Java and Swift, respectively. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are also several strong, web-based solutions for developing cross-platform desktop software with just HTML, CSS and JavaScript, such as </span><a href="https://electronjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electron</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12028 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Science</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the field of data science, Python and R are the most useful languages you can learn. Python is like a swiss army knife of programming languages that were designed for general purpose use. However, the strength of Python comes from the vast wealth of free data analysis libraries that are packed full of capabilities. One of the most popular data analysis libraries, Pandas, comes with tools that allow you to import information from spreadsheets or processing sets for time-series analysis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">R is another programming language that is geared towards statistical analysis and graphing. With R, you can include </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">linear and nonlinear modeling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, and more.</span></p>
<h2><b>I Want to Run a Startup</b></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web-based startups have a lot of options when it comes to choosing a programming language. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For e-commerce startups, PHP is a great language to start with. WordPress runs on PHP and is a great starting platform for e-commerce websites.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to start a SaaS (Software as a Service) startup, Java is a necessary language to learn. With Java, you’ll be able to develop software for a huge variety of platforms, from Android to Windows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to the Ruby on Rails framework, Ruby is a powerful, easy-to-use language that makes prototyping a breeze. As a high-level language, you’ll be able to create prototypes quickly and bring your idea to life with minimal effort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, we have JavaScript which directly affects the overall performance of your website. Since your startup is web-based, the performance and user experience is extremely important. These days, search engines like Google will punish you and lower your search results rankings for a slow loading and laggy site. This can make a huge impact on the number of visitors and conversions you receive.</span></p>
<h2><b>I Want to Run a Startup (Version 2.0) </b></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the storefront of an online shop is a website, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will be necessary for the front-end. However, you do have plenty of options for the back-end, which accounts for all of the “behind-the-scenes” operations of your online store. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For handling the back-end, you’ll most likely use Node.js (JavaScript), Ruby, or PHP. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the three, Node.js is the most popular and widely used, both because of its speed and its basis in JavaScript. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since your startup is web-based, the performance and user experience is extremely important. These days, search engines like Google will punish you and lower your search results rankings for a slow loading and laggy site. This can make a huge impact on the amount of visitors and conversions you receive. Therefore, we would recommend the fastest option, Node.js, for the back end. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In extreme cases, you may need to learn Python or R for the back end of your site, but only if you’re dealing with huge amounts of customer or product data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’d like an easier solution that’s already set up for you, try building your e-commerce shop in WordPress, a PHP-based solution. With WordPress, you can use a drag-and-drop interface to construct the façade of your store, while the program takes care of the front end and back end. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although WordPress is relatively easy to use, you’ll still want to learn the language or hire a PHP developer to add any additional features or troubleshoot problems as they arise. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile-based startups like Uber are quite popular and successful at the moment. To launch a startup in the mobile space, it’s important that you create apps that are available on both iPhone and Android. It’s actually possible to develop cross-platform applications in Java using React Native, Ionic, PhoneGap, or Cordova, but it’s recommended that you learn the native programming languages for each platform for the best performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re not able to code it all yourself, hiring a mobile developer that specializes in a specific operating system can be helpful. You’ll need to hire a Java developer for Android, a Swift developer for iOS, a rare talent that may know both, or opt for a cross-platform solution. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Game</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a startup, you likely won’t have the money and resources to develop ‘AAA’ titles like the big studios. Instead, indie developers tend to focus on storyline and creativity when developing games. C++ is complicated, takes time, and is often difficult to use, meaning that it’s not your best choice as a startup. C# is easier to use and will allow you to release games more quickly and on time. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6956" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/gaming-1.jpg" alt="" width="4928" height="3264" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/gaming-1.jpg 4928w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/gaming-1-300x199.jpg 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/gaming-1-768x509.jpg 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/gaming-1-1024x678.jpg 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/gaming-1-1080x715.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 4928px) 100vw, 4928px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web-based games are another great place to start for new game developers. Through HTML5 and JavaScript, you can create incredible games. To find out what kind of games you can develop with HTML5 and JavaScript, check out this article: </span><a href="https://tutorialzine.com/2015/02/30-amazing-games-made-only-with-html5" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://tutorialzine.com/2015/02/30-amazing-games-made-only-with-html5</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if you have the patience, skills, and dedication to create an amazing 3D game, you should learn C++. This powerful programming language from Microsoft is just about all you need to create stunning games for console and PC. </span></p>
<h2><b>I Want to Build Something Fun</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most appealing aspect of programming is not only that it’s useful and highly paid, but also that it can be a lot of fun. If you want to create something cool with coding, you should first consider what kinds of projects interest you. Would you like to create a new mobile app, a web-based game, or even your own AI? Perhaps, you’d like to automate your daily tasks at work or create something for Google Apps (G-Suite)? With a good understanding of the following languages, your imagination will be the only limit to what you can create. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small Games</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t think you need to be a professional programmer to begin following your dream as a game developer; all you need to know is HTML5, JavaScript, and some WebGL. Both Doodle Jump and the incredibly famous (or infamous) mobile game, Flappy Bird, are powered by HTML5 and JavaScript. Sure, you won’t be making ‘AAA’ games for consoles any time soon, but you’ll be surprised by what you can create with limited knowledge of coding. For slightly more advanced games on desktop, you’ll want to utilize languages like C# and Python. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Apps (G-Suite)</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JavaScript is the backbone for creating apps within the Google ecosystem, or the G-Suite, as it is commonly referred to. Google claims that any web apps in the G-Suite can be created with JavaScript and nothing more. This is a bit of an odd claim, considering that Gmail is actually written in Java, not JavaScript. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless, learning</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> JavaScript is not necessary to create apps in G-Suite anymore. Instead, the new Google App Maker gives you a drag-and-drop interface that allows you to create custom applications and provides you with APIs for all of Google’s applications, such as Google Maps and Google Translate. The API, or Application Program Interface, is the key that enables the communication between other Google apps and your own custom app. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Task Automation</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you ever spent countless hours updating a spreadsheet, renaming files, or reorganizing items with your keyboard and mouse? During that mind-numbing experience, did you ever stop to think that there might be a better way? Task Automation is an entire field of programming that is dedicated to automating the boring, mindless tasks that a human would rather not do. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using basic general-purpose languages like Python and Ruby, you can tell your computer to do all of the grunt work for you. Beyond saving time and stress, automating daily tasks will result in more accurate work, since we tend to make mistakes as we get tired, distracted, and bored. Computers, on the other hand, put their heads down and get the work done without fail.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simple AI (Artificial Intelligence)</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, Python has become increasingly popular in the field of Artificial Intelligence. One of the greatest challenges for software developers of AI is the problem of “deep learning”, which is the ability to learn as a human does. Today, “neural mapping” is a widely-used technique in AI that involves creating large decision-making branches. Each connection is treated as if it were a neuron and a synapse in the brain. Using this technique, researchers in AI hope to create a replica of the brain that reasons and even has the creative capacities like that of a human.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TensorFlow is a great library of resources for Python and other programming languages. While it was primarily developed for use with Python, TensorFlow.js has been released for JavaScript with the intention of using machine learning on the web. In other words, you can even use JavaScript to experiment with AI through the use of TensorFlow. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Landing those first few developer roles in your career can be hard.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you convince someone to hire you when you have limited experience? What things are critical to know? What if you get asked a question you don’t know the answer to?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> need to know </span><a href="https://twitter.com/ppk/status/963850873003757569" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">how to write a &lt;link&gt; tag from scratch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Spoiler: you don’t).</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve been working as a web developer for about a decade. I’ve held various roles in companies of all shapes and sizes — from global tech companies to small local agencies. I’ve been interviewed more times than I can count, and I’ve had more rejections than successes. As I have progressed to more senior positions, I increasingly find myself on the other side of the table.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m going to share some things that I look for when I’m interviewing new candidates. Perhaps more importantly, they are things that have helped me feel more confident when I’m the one being interviewed.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The technical requirements of any given role will vary, so I won’t be giving you any suggestions about addressing those. There are plenty of articles with titles like </span><b>“10 Things Every Modern Web Developer Must Know”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You can use those to guide (or more likely, overwhelm) you.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What I am going to suggest, overall, is that you shouldn’t fret about the things you </span><b>don’t know</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>1. Be comfortable with your experience and abilities</b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking about your experience is usually the starting point for an interview. It’s also usually the first thing on your CV. Showing your experience and how you’ve applied your skills and abilities is a fundamental part of any interview process.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s normal to feel the pressure of making a good first impression. As such, it can be tempting to oversell yourself and your abilities, or to exaggerate the importance of a project you have worked on.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But you must remember — you’re not expected to have a wealth of experience or technical ability when starting out. Exaggerating or overselling your experience will create a less than ideal first impression, even if you’re otherwise well-suited for the role. This is something that is true at any point in your career, but it’s an easy trap to fall into when you’re starting out.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s much better to simply be factual about your experience and ability. Talk about the projects you’ve worked on and your specific role within those projects. Highlight the skills you used and technology you’ve been exposed to while working on them.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show, don’t tell.</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a principle in story-telling that I think also applies to job interviews.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t </span><b>tell</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> your audience what is happening, </span><b>show</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> them with actions and allow them to interpret it and arrive at a conclusion themselves.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if the interviewer can arrive at this conclusion by themselves:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This candidate is experienced with Y, and is clearly passionate about X”.</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is much more valuable than you telling them:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m highly experienced with Y, and very passionate about X”.</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equally as important as not overselling your skills and experience is being able to admit you don’t know something.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12028 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><b>2. Don’t be afraid to say “I don’t know”</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s easy to feel pressured to answer a question you don’t know the answer to. If you do, this is what is likely to happen:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll copy/paste together snippets of information you’ve heard or read and regurgitate whatever comes to mind first. You’ll hope to hit on the right combination of words to answer the question. You’ll stumble, sound incoherent, and get flustered.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let me be as unambiguous about this as possible. Saying “I don’t know” when you don’t know the answer to something is </span><b>always</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the best answer. Don’t pretend to know something you don’t.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re made to feel uncomfortable for saying “I don’t know” in an interview, you should treat that as a red flag. It’s usually a sign of a toxic workplace. You don’t want to work at a company that doesn’t encourage vulnerability.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t know something, always be upfront and admit it. You can always follow up with what you think</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the answer might be. Even better, you can follow up with a question.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t know much about X, but I think it’s related to Y. Can you give me some more detail? Are you using X in your projects?</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often, the answer to your follow up questions will allow you to give a secondary response. Even though you didn’t know the answer, you can show that you understand the context.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12255 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>3. Ask questions. Lots of them.</b><b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asking follow up questions is also a great way to make an interview feel less formal and more like a discussion.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interviewers are often more than happy to talk about their experience with a particular technology, or the challenges they’ve faced on a particular project. This can also help give you insight into why they consider a certain skill or technology to be important for the role.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also remember that an interview is also about you evaluating your potential employer. You can’t properly evaluate them without asking questions.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What project will I be working on? What are some projects this company has recently completed? How large is the team I will be working in? What resources will be available to me for training and personal development?</span></i><br />
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This isn’t only something that is valuable for the interview. Making an objective evaluation of your options is a daily task for a developer. To do that, you need to gather the right information — and to do that, you need to ask questions. Lots of them.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>The candidate with the best technical skills isn’t always the one that gets hired.</b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">My intention here isn’t to sound authoritative about what you should or shouldn’t do in an interview. Nor is it to proclaim that technical skills don’t matter.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, what I am trying to make clear is that learning isn’t linear. You can’t, and won’t, know </span><b>everything</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> required for a role. We all take different paths to get to where we are, and you should be comfortable with that fact.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every role is different, and every organization will have different expectations for their candidates. But, regardless of your skill level, or the expectations of the role, you should:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be comfortable with your current skill level and experience.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Know that it’s acceptable to say “I don’t know”.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feel confident asking questions about things you don’t understand.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I believe these principles are not only essential for doing well in interviews, but can help you succeed in every role you will ever have, at every level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hope there is something you can take away from this article or perhaps you have had success with different strategies.</span></p>

<ul>
<li class="entry-title"><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/interview-tips-that-will-give-you-confidence-and-help-you-land-a-dev-job/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Interview tips that will give you confidence and help you land a dev job</a></li>
<li><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/category/basics-of-programming/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Basics of programming</a></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Before you learn to code, think about what you want to code</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing how to code is mostly about building things, and the path is a lot clearer when you have a sense of the end goal. If your goal is “learn to code,” without a clear idea of the kinds of programs you will write and how they will make your life better, you will probably find it a frustrating exercise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m a little ashamed to admit that part of my motivation for studying computer science was that I wanted to prove I was smart, and I wanted to be able to get Smart Person jobs. I also liked thinking about math and theory (</span><a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Godel-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this book</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> blew my mind at an impressionable age) and the program was a good fit. It wasn’t enough to sustain me for long, though, until I found ways to connect technology to the things I really loved, like music and literature.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what do you want to code? Websites? Games? iPhone apps? A startup that makes you rich? Interactive art? Do you want to be able to impress your boss or automate a tedious task so you can spend more time looking at otter pictures? Perhaps you simply want to be more employable, add a buzzword to your resume, or fulfill the requirements of your educational program. All of these are worthy goals. Make sure you know which one is yours, and study accordingly.</span></p>
<h3><b>There’s nothing mystical about it</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coding is a skill like any other. Like language learning, there’s grammar and vocabulary to acquire. Like math, there are processes to work through specific types of problems. Like all kinds of craftsmanship and art-making, there are techniques and tools and best practices that people have developed over time, specialized to different tasks, that you’re free to use or modify or discard.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/ThePerilsofJavaSchools.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This guy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (a very smart guy! Whose other writings I enjoy and frequently agree with!) posits that there is a bright line between people with the True Mind of a Programmer and everyone else, who are lacking the intellectual capacity needed to succeed in the field. That bright line consists, according to him, of pointers and recursion (there are primers </span><a href="http://alumni.cs.ucr.edu/~pdiloren/C++_Pointers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://inventwithpython.com/blog/2011/08/11/recursion-explained-with-the-flood-fill-algorithm-and-zombies-and-cats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the curious).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I learned about pointers and recursion in school, and when I understood them, it was a delightful jolt to my brain — the kind of intellectual pleasure that made me want to study computer science in the first place. But, outside of classroom exercises, the number of times I’ve had to be familiar with either concept to get things done has been relatively small. And when helping others learn, over and over again, I’ve watched people complete interesting and rewarding projects without knowing anything about either one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no point in being intimidated or wondering if you’re Smart Enough. Sure, the more complex and esoteric your task, the higher the level of mastery you will need to complete it. But this is true in absolutely every other field. Unless you’re planning to make your living entirely by your code, chances are you don’t have to be a recursion-understanding genius to make the thing you want to make.</span></p>
<h3><b>It never works the first time</b></h3>
<h4><b>And probably won’t the second or third time</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you first start learning to code, you’ll very quickly run up against this particular experience: you think you’ve set up everything the way you’re supposed to, you’ve checked and re-checked it, and it still. doesn’t. work. You don’t have a clue where to begin trying to fix it, and the error message (if you’re lucky enough to have one at all) might as well say “fuck you.” You might be tempted to give up at this point, thinking that you’ll never figure it out, that you’re not cut out for this. I had that feeling the first time I tried to write a program in C++, ran it, and got only the words “segmentation fault” for my trouble.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this experience is so common for programmers of all skill levels that it says absolutely nothing about your intelligence, tech-savviness, or suitability for the coding life. It will happen to you as a beginner, but it will also happen to you as an experienced programmer. The main difference will be in how you respond to it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve found that a big difference between new coders and experienced coders is faith: faith that things are going wrong for a logical and discoverable reason, faith that problems are fixable, faith that there is a way to accomplish the goal. The path from “not working” to “working” might not be obvious, but with patience you can usually find it.</span></p>
<h3><b>Someone will always tell you you’re doing it wrong</b></h3>
<p><a href="http://theprofoundprogrammer.com/page/17" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Braces should go on the next line</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/2782" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Braces should go on the same line</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="http://derkarl.org/why_to_tabs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use tabs to indent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TabsAreEvil" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But tabs are evil</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You should </span><a href="http://mysqlstoredprocedure.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=51&amp;Itemid=40" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">use stored procedures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but actually </span><a href="http://www.tonymarston.co.uk/php-mysql/stored-procedures-are-evil.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you shouldn’t use them</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You should </span><a href="http://www.lanoie.net/classes/DHTML/programming/lectures/lecture.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">always comment your code</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But </span><a href="http://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2013/06/01/roc-rocks.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">good code doesn’t need comments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are almost always many different approaches to a particular problem, with no single “right way.” A lot of programmers get very good at advocating for their preferred way, but that doesn’t mean it’s the One True Path. Going head-to-head with people telling me I was Wrong, and trying to figure out if they were right, was one of the more stressful aspects of my early career.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re coding in a team with other people, someone will almost certainly take issue with something that you’re doing. Sometimes they’ll be absolutely correct, and it’s always worth investigating to see whether you are, in fact, Doing It Wrong. But sometimes they will be full of shit or re-enacting an ancient and meaningless dispute where it would be best to just follow a style guide and forget about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, if you’re the kind of person who enjoys ancient but meaningless disputes (grammar nerds, I’m looking at you), you’ve come to the right place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Coding” means a lot of different things to a lot of different people, and it looks different now from how it used to. And, funnily enough, the tools and packages and frameworks that make it faster and easier for newcomers or even trained developers to build things are most likely to be tarred with the “not for REAL coders” brush. (See: “</span><a href="http://blog.enfranchisedmind.com/2009/04/return-of-the-real-programmer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Return of the Real Programmer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">”)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behind all this is the fear that </span><a href="http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2013/08/21/chase-felker-youre-not-a-computer-programmer-and-thats-ok/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">if “anyone” can call themselves a programmer, the title will become meaningless</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But I think that this gatekeeping is destructive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the tools that make it easiest to build the things you want to build. If that means your game was made in Stencyl or GameMaker rather than written from scratch, that’s fine. If your first foray into coding is HTML or Excel macros, that’s fine. Work with something you feel you can stick with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you get more comfortable, you’ll naturally start to find those tools limiting rather than helpful and look for more powerful ones. But most of the time, few people will ever even look at your code or even ask what you used — It’s what you make with it that counts.</span></p>
<h3><b>Worrying about “geek cred” will slowly kill you</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">See above. I used to worry a lot, especially in school, about whether I was identifying myself as “not a real geek” (and therefore less worthy of inclusion in tech communities) through my clothing, my presentation, my choice of reading material and even my software customization choices. It was a terrible waste of energy and I became a lot more functional after I made the decision to let it all go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to internalize this: your ability to get good at coding has </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">nothing</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to do with how well you fit into the various geek subcultures. This goes double if you know deep down that you’ll never quite fit. The energy you spend proving yourself should be going into making things instead. And, if you’re an indisputable geek with cred leaking from your eye sockets, keep this in mind for when you’re evaluating someone else’s cred level. It may not mean what you think it does.</span></p>

<h3><b>Sticking with it is more important than the method</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no shortage of articles about the “right” or “best” way to learn how to code, and there are lots of potential approaches. You can learn the concepts </span><a href="http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">from a book</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or by </span><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">completing interactive exercises</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or by </span><a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/intro.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">debugging things that others have written</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And, of course, there are lots of languages you might choose as your first to learn, with advocates for each.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A common complaint with “teach yourself to code” programs and workshops is that you’ll breeze happily through the beginner material and then hit a steep curve where things get more difficult very quickly. You know how to print some lines of text on a page but have no idea where to start working on a “real,” useful project. You might feel like you were just following directions without really understanding and blame the learning materials.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12255 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you get to this stage, most of the tutorials and online resources available to you are much less useful because they assume you’re already an experienced and comfortable programmer. The difficulty is further compounded by the fact that “you don’t know what you don’t know.” Even trying to figure out what to learn next is a puzzle in itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll hit this wall no matter what “learn to code” program you follow, and the only way to get past it is to persevere. This means you keep trying new things, learning more information, and figuring out, piece by piece, how to build your project. You’re a lot more likely to find success in the end if you have a clear idea of why you’re learning to code in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you keep putting bricks on top of each other, it might take a long time but eventually, you’ll have a wall. This is where that faith I mentioned earlier comes in handy. If you believe that with time and patience you can figure the whole coding thing out, in time you almost certainly will. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

<h3><b>What is programming?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose that you work for a multinational company and you have an upcoming meeting with a businessman from China. Your native language is [insert local language] and you don’t speak a word of Chinese. However, you remember that your second language is English and that the Chinese businessman speaks English as well. You then begin to use English as a common language to negotiate and communicate with each other. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12017 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3><b>What language do computers speak?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A computer’s native language is binary: an incredibly long list of 1’s and 0’s. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Binary</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> isn’t very easy for people to read or write, so we came up with programming languages to talk with computers, instead. Since computers don’t know human languages, we have to meet in the middle somewhere. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, unlike humans, computers aren’t able to pick up on indirect communication and always take things very literally. If you tell them something, they will do it exactly as they are told. Computers aren’t smart enough to make decisions on their own and won’t understand information that isn’t spelt out for them. For this reason, you need to make sure that you’re giving them exact instructions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if I told you to make a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sandwich</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you might ask me what ingredients I want on that sandwich and if I want it toasted or not. To you, that might be all you need to know to make me a delicious sandwich. However, there are many small decisions and previous knowledge involved in making a sandwich. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you simply tell a computer that you want a toasted ham and cheese sandwich with rye bread and mayonnaise, you might get something very different from what you ordered. A human would know that the mayonnaise goes on the slices of bread first, the ham and cheese are added second, then the sandwich is placed in the oven to be toasted. </span></p>
<h3><b>But, how is a computer supposed to know all</b> that?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember that we told the computer that we want, “a toasted ham and cheese sandwich with rye bread and mayonnaise.” To a computer, it might be logical to do all of those things in order. It would toast the ham and cheese by themselves, put two slices of rye bread on top, and then spread mayonnaise on the bread. </span></p>
<h3>Aren’t computers supposed to be smarter than that?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, because the computer takes things</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> literally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you have to specify the order of each step and the placement of each ingredient. Everyone knows that the ingredients go between the pieces of bread, but a computer has no previous knowledge of what a sandwich is like—it’s just following your direct instructions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is another reason why we can’t communicate with computers using human languages, just yet. Our languages are simply too ambiguous and too vague for a computer to understand properly. Also, if a word or a sentence might have a double meaning, a computer wouldn’t know how to interpret it. It needs everything spelt out for it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The truth is that computers aren’t smart at all; they just happen to process information faster than us. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6210" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/code.2-1.jpg" alt="" width="5472" height="3648" /></p>
<h3>What is a programmer and what do they do?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember, you can’t just tell the computer in English what you want. You’ll need a computer programmer to translate for you. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A computer programmer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a person who communicates your ideas and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">instructions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to a computer, making websites, games, and other programs appear on the screen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A programmer could also be defined as a polyglot (one who knows many languages) that specializes in talking to computers. They know exactly what to say and how to say it so that the computer will understand them. If you’ve ever learned another language, you know that each language comes with its own vocabulary, grammar, and set of rules. Computer languages also come with their own way of saying things, called syntax. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a person might understand you if you </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mispronounce</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a word, use the wrong conjugation, or mess up your grammar, a computer is a lot less forgiving with mistakes. As soon as you make a syntax error, the computer will stop listening to you and quit running the program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How rude. </span></p>
<h3>What are you able to accomplish with coding skills?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve ever used a computer, watched videos online, or played video games, it might be hard to believe that all of that comes from just a series of letters and symbols. The ability to process thousands of lines of code per second is the strength of a computer and allows it to follow highly complex instructions and accomplish incredible tasks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s take a look at some of the cool things you can do with code:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create &amp; Design Websites</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Build Mobile Apps</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Develop Desktop Programs</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Develop Video Games</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create &amp; Maintain Databases</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automate Tasks</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solve Complex Problems</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create Artificial Intelligence</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perform Statistical Analysis</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And much more&#8230;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re interested in any of these activities and would like to do them for a living, learning to program is definitely an important skill to have. </span></p>

<h3>What makes coding useful and what is it good for?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we rely more and more on computers in our daily lives, the importance of computer programming and coding continues to grow as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the coming years, nearly all fields will involve computer programming and learning to code will give you an edge in your future career. For example, you can use programming skills in the areas of writing, analysis, management, engineering, software development, and so much more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advocates of programming see learning to code as a universal skill that everyone should have, such as the ability to read and write or perform simple mathematical equations. Many governments around the world believe this as well and have proposed initiatives to teach coding to kids alongside core curriculum in schools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like us, they see coding as the key to staying competitive in a global marketplace. </span></p>
<h3>I already know it’s useful, but what is programming actually like?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average day in the life of a programmer isn’t as glamorous as it might appear in movies or on television shows. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being a programmer requires a lot of concentration, patience, and a self-driven attitude. If you aren’t able to sit down and focus for hours at a time, you might want to reconsider pursuing a career in computer programming. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some programming jobs may require you to work on an irregular schedule and be available to fix bugs and solve problems immediately as they appear. Others may have you work from nine to five o’clock, just like a regular job. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, working as a computer programmer might give you more freedom than your current job allows. A good number of programming jobs are remote, meaning that you can code while at home, at a café, or while you get a tan at the beach—given that the wifi signal reaches that far. </span></p>
<h3>Is programming really right for me?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where the rubber meets the road and where you’ll have to seriously weigh the computer programmer pros and cons. Perhaps, you’ve had an unrealistic idea of what programming is like and haven’t considered that coding is just like any other job out there—it’s still hard work. However, if you meet the following criteria, chances are that you’ll love every second of it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Signs that Programming Isn’t Right for You:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are only motivated by money and aren’t interested in computers at all</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t like to sit down for long periods of time</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your eyes glaze over when you look at a page of code</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are relatively slow at typing and often make many typos</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Signs that Programming IS Right For You:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You describe yourself as both analytical AND creative</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have high attention to detail</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are comfortable working with others and working alone</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have a good basis for understanding written English</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You love problem-solving</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You love to always learn new things</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You adapt well to change</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You like to organize information and automate processes</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>What programming languages do I choose and where do I start?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s go back to the example of our meeting with the Chinese businessman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although English may be useful in a business setting, you might find that you need to learn other languages for different fields. For example, you might want to know French for diplomacy, Greek for philosophy, and German in the field of engineering. Depending on what field you work in, you will choose a specific language to meet your needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You won’t have the time or ability to learn every programming language out there, so you’ll need to be strategic about what languages you will learn. First, you need to determine what your focus is and what languages you need to know to accomplish your personal goals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While technically not programming languages, HTML and CSS are great languages to start with to begin learning the fundamentals of how programming works. HTML and CSS are “text markup languages” which are actually languages that we use to format and organize the text. Without HTML or CSS, your browser wouldn’t know if these words I’m writing are a headline, a paragraph, or a footer. It also wouldn’t know if these words should be bolded, italicized, etc. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even as I write this article, I am using HTML and CSS to help you and your internet browser understand what I have to say. </span></p>

<h3>TL;DR (Too Long; Didn’t Read)</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In summary, programming is a high-paying career that requires patience, dedication, and extremely high attention to detail. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you hate sitting down at a computer and aren’t willing to put in the time to practice, you’ll likely hate programming and give up rather quickly. You also won’t do well if you are motivated by the paycheck and have no interest in the job itself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if you love learning new things, are self-motivated, and have a can-do attitude, you’ll succeed—regardless of your educational background.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>János Farkas</strong> is a construction technician, an applied graphic artist and a baker by profession.<br />
He has been working as a junior frontend developer at Y-collective (a Hungarian company) since January.</p>
<p><strong>In this episode of <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/category/codeberry-student-stories/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Student Stories</a>, let us take you on a follow-up journey</strong> with a former CodeBerry Programming School student.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I live here</strong>: Pécs, Hungary</p>
<p><strong>I work here</strong>: <a href="https://y-collective.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Y-collective</a></p>
<p><strong>I studied at CodeBerry for this long</strong>: 2 months</p>
<p><strong>I use</strong>: PHPStorm, Stack Overflow, CSS-tricks, W3Schools</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>When you&#8217;re asked about your profession, how do you answer?</strong></h3>
<p>First of all, I say that I am a programmer, usually everyone understands this.<br />
In most cases, people are interested when I tell them my profession. So, I give more details by explaining that I prepare the user interface of web pages visible to users.<br />
Sometimes I work on server-side scripting too&#8230;</p>
<h3><strong>What did you do for a living before you switched to web development?</strong></h3>
<p>This is the first time I work as a website developer. However, I started to get familiar with this field much earlier.<br />
I&#8217;ve been interested in this field for the past 10 years, but I only started taking it seriously last year.<br />
So far I only created some smaller websites (and I would do these in a different way now <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ).<br />
As for my previous jobs, I worked in the trading sector for 10 years.<br />
As the manager of the bakery department of a 7000 square meter superstore, my task was to supervise production, procurement, schedules and anything related.<br />
So, it was quite a big change for me.</p>

<h3><strong>Why did you decide to start studying web development?</strong></h3>
<p>I have always been fascinated by the software part of computer science.<br />
Each year, the internet and web-related technologies play a greater and greater role in our everyday life.<br />
This results in an urging need for more and more professional developers. I would like to take this chance. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h3><strong>Tell me a little about where you work now, what your duties are. What do you do on a typical day or week?</strong></h3>
<p>I work as a junior site builder at Y-collective. Our office is in downtown Pécs.<br />
At the beginning of the week, there is a project management meeting where the tasks are determined and assigned. So it is more or less clear what everyone is going to work on during the week and maybe the following week.<br />
We have a lot of projects, so we have quite a variety of tasks.<br />
And it may happen that some urgent matter or a bug comes up on an ad hoc basis.<br />
My days usually start around 6 a.m., with a coffee.<br />
While drinking it, I glance over the news or I read about something I was dealing with the previous day.<br />
I usually go to work by bike. The official working hours are from eight in the morning to four in the afternoon, plus at times I stay a half-hour or an hour longer.<br />
Besides developments we do changes, bug fixes, importing existing modules to other projects, administrative duties, database modification&#8230;<br />
We recently started to concentrate more on unique WordPress developments.<br />
At times it needs some research or a plugin change, so it&#8217;s not boring.<br />
What I use daily is PHP, HTML, CSS, SCSS/LESS, Javascript/jQuery, Node/Bower, Bootstrap, and git.<br />
There are weekly/biweekly internal training and meetups on some subject.</p>

<h3><strong>How long were you looking for a job? Was it hard to find a place to work?</strong></h3>
<p>After all, I wasn&#8217;t looking for a job for long. Or rather, I did not expect to be able to enter the world of IT within such a short period of time.<br />
<a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/im-adam-freisinger-the-founder-of-codeberry-and-this-is-how-i-work/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Adam Freisinger</a>, one of the mentors at CodeBerry asked me about my professional goals, as I was making good progress with the materials.<br />
I didn&#8217;t keep it a secret that I intended to work in this field, so he organized an interview for me, then I got a trial task, and later a job.<br />
Hereby I&#8217;d like to thank everyone for the support, I&#8217;ll do my best to make up for it <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h3><strong>How did you learn programming? What kind of courses, books etc. did you use?</strong></h3>
<p>At first, I researched online materials, read articles and did tutorials.<br />
Then there was even more self-studying and then the next step was CodeBerry.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12018 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>What did CodeBerry offer you? What was it like to study at our school?</strong></h3>
<p>I was looking for an online course that could help me get to the next level. But for various reasons, none of them seemed really good.<br />
Then I stumbled upon CodeBerry.<br />
I really liked the approach: they not only realized that individuals need this course, but also that the IT sector is in need of junior professionals.<br />
A symbiotic relationship is built from this approach, which serves everyone&#8217;s needs.<br />
Studying is completely personalized: everyone can progress at their own pace. If someone is stuck, help is available from the Slack community, and Amanda.<br />
I wouldn&#8217;t say that I found very many new pieces of information in the teaching material, but for me, it was very useful for revising, for filling in the gaps I had, for deepening my knowledge&#8230;<br />
Personally, the extra service CodeBerry provided me was that I could assess my knowledge quite well, so I was more confident to make the decision to try myself out.</p>
<h3><strong>Do you have any experience, tips or tricks to share with those who are just starting their studies?</strong></h3>
<p>Start a side project while studying. Give a solution to a real problem, no matter how small it may be.<br />
You can learn a lot this way.<br />
Feel free to copy a solution or parts of it, but plan your own version and analyze and understand the parts that are not obvious to you.<br />
Even the scope of your studies can be built on this.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12255 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>What is the next step for you? What direction are you taking?</strong></h3>
<p>First of all, I definitely want to deepen my knowledge and catch up with my colleagues.<br />
We have a very well-prepared and seasoned team. Everyone is really good at what they do, and I learn a lot from them every day.<br />
Then I want to reach my own limits, and then&#8230; we&#8217;ll see.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Márton Radnóczi</strong>, Marci is an agronomist specialised in rural development. He&#8217;s been passionate about web and mobile related products from day one, finally last year he decided to devote more time to them. He now works at Apertus Ltd. as a sitebuilder.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I live here:</strong> Budapest, Hungary</p>
<p><strong>I work here:</strong> Apertus Ltd.</p>
<p><strong>Time spent studying with CodeBerry:</strong> 6 months</p>
<p><strong>I work with:</strong> Oneplus One, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">PhpStorm</a>, Adobe*</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>When you&#8217;re asked about your profession, how do you answer?</strong></h3>
<p>Briefly: I’m a site builder or web developer. I build websites without a function. My task is to convert sketches into code, so the desired design appears in the browser.</p>
<h3><strong>What did you do for a living before you started coding? Did you have any relevant experience in this field?</strong></h3>
<p>I worked in finance before I became a project manager in a startup. I&#8217;ve never learned to code, I just had an idea of how things worked and what logic they followed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12018 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Why did you decide to start <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/a-brief-introduction-to-web-development/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">studying web development</a>?</strong></h3>
<p>It always appealed to me as a hobby. Time flew by when I started digging into related topics, I felt unstoppable. It was an unmistakable flow experience I&#8217;ve never experienced before during work. I liked the thought of doing this full-time. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h3><strong>Tell me a little about where you work now, what your duties are. What do you do on a typical day or week?</strong></h3>
<p>We develop various size web systems at Apertus Ltd. As a site builder, my role is to create a static page out of a specified design or just simple sketches. Most of the time I get a few pictures that guide my code. I work on numerous projects simultaneously, but normally I focus on just one each day.</p>
<h3><strong>How long were you looking for a job? Was it hard to find a place to work?</strong></h3>
<p>I searched for 1 week, so I admit it was surprisingly easy. I suspected it would be fast, but not this fast though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8199" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/programming-2480671_1920-1024x683.jpg" alt="Never too late to build a career as a sitebuilder" width="1024" height="683" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/programming-2480671_1920-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/programming-2480671_1920-300x200.jpg 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/programming-2480671_1920-768x512.jpg 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/programming-2480671_1920-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/programming-2480671_1920-1080x720.jpg 1080w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/programming-2480671_1920.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></strong></p>
<h3><strong>How did you learn programming? What kind of courses, books etc. did you use?</strong></h3>
<p>I only enrolled in online courses. First, I tested myself on free materials and then I paid for two that complemented each other. I also watched tutorials on Youtube to gain a deeper insight into some interesting topics.</p>
<h3><strong>What did CodeBerry offer you? What was it like to study at our school?</strong></h3>
<p>The biggest advantage of CodeBerry is that it gives an overview of the whole process of web development, guiding you step by step through all the different stages. This helps you decide which part of it fits you most.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12255 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Do you have any experience, tips or tricks to share with those who are just starting their studies?</strong></h3>
<p>Web development has many different areas, it’s worth choosing a few to focus on, and just briefly know the others. If you ever need more, you can always learn it then.</p>
<h3><strong>What is the next step for you? What direction are you taking?</strong></h3>
<p>I would like to learn as much as possible and bring some of my own ideas to life. I’ve never let go of my agricultural knowledge, it will be exciting to see how it might come together with IT.</p>

We had a chat with Attila about how he got here, what he learned about programming, and the difficulties of finding a job as a junior developer. </span></p>
<h3><strong>When someone asked about your profession a few months ago, how did you answer? </strong></h3>
<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;I used to say my job is networking at IT Services, meaning that I helped big companies join the internet. Our task spread from assuring the router arrived at the customer to actually making it work.&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:384,&quot;10&quot;:1,&quot;11&quot;:3}">I used to say my job is networking at <a href="https://www.it-services.hu/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">IT Services,</a> meaning that I helped big companies join the internet. Our task spread from assuring the router arrived at the customer to actually making it work. </span></p>
<h3><strong>And what is your answer now?</strong></h3>
<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;I’m a frontend UI developer at EPAM. I work in a bigger team, developing an application relying mainly on frontend technologies and designing the user interface. I use HTML, CSS and JavaScript on a daily basis.&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:384,&quot;10&quot;:1,&quot;11&quot;:3}">I’m a frontend UI developer at <a href="https://www.epam.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">EPAM</a>.

<h3><strong>That sounds great! So, programming wasn’t really a new task for you, was it? Did you encounter coding earlier?</strong></h3>
<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;I’m a frontend UI developer at EPAM. I work in a bigger team, developing an application relying mainly on frontend technologies and designing the user interface. I use HTML, CSS and JavaScript on a daily basis.&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:384,&quot;10&quot;:1,&quot;11&quot;:3}">Yes, I actually started using HTML and CSS during elementary school. Later in high school, we used Python all the time, relying on an antique book. I had to quit doing it because the libraries cited by the author didn’t exist anymore, so the tasks were unsolvable. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></p>
<h3><strong>Where did the idea of web development come from? </strong></h3>
<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;I’m a frontend UI developer at EPAM. I work in a bigger team, developing an application relying mainly on frontend technologies and designing the user interface. I use HTML, CSS and JavaScript on a daily basis.&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:384,&quot;10&quot;:1,&quot;11&quot;:3}">During my senior year of high school, two guys approached me, saying they needed web developers for their startup. Back then I had no clue about what I was about to dive into, but I said yes and I soon got the hang of it. Eventually, we finished the project, but web development had caught my attention, so I continued learning it on my own. Finally, I ran into a dead-end in spring, when I felt I can’t go on alone, I need a teacher. That’s when I found you. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </span></p>

<h3><strong>How long have you been studying with CodeBerry? </strong></h3>
<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;I’m a frontend UI developer at EPAM. I work in a bigger team, developing an application relying mainly on frontend technologies and designing the user interface. I use HTML, CSS and JavaScript on a daily basis.&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:384,&quot;10&quot;:1,&quot;11&quot;:3}">Since June 2016. </span></p>
<h3><strong>And how did you like it, what were the advantages? </strong></h3>
<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;I’m a frontend UI developer at EPAM. I work in a bigger team, developing an application relying mainly on frontend technologies and designing the user interface. I use HTML, CSS and JavaScript on a daily basis.&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:384,&quot;10&quot;:1,&quot;11&quot;:3}">To be honest, there wasn&#8217;t a tremendous amount of new information, but the course was great for recollecting my knowledge. The mentors helped me a lot – that was probably one of the best things in it. Having someone to discuss your problems with is a huge advantage. </span></p>

<p>That’s good to hear. Now it’s the beginning of autumn, that means you’ve gained enough knowledge in 3 months to find a job.</p>

Two weeks later EPAM contacted me. I was going to create a portfolio before contemplating looking for a job, but EPAM was faster. They invited me to an interview right away. </span></p>
<h3><strong>I wanted to ask you if the search was difficult, but I guess we can skip this question. </strong></h3>

<h3><strong>What is the next step for you? What direction are you taking? </strong></h3>

It’s also a huge dream of mine to teach programming in some form. Giving lectures or taking part in some more specific program, I don’t know yet, nor do I know how it’s going to happen, but I’m sure it will happen somehow. </span></p>
<h3><strong>As a well-experienced student, do you have any tips for those just starting to code? </strong></h3>
<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;I’m a frontend UI developer at EPAM.

I use HTML, CSS and JavaScript on a daily basis.&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:384,&quot;10&quot;:1,&quot;11&quot;:3}">I think it’s important to understand that the learning process can’t really be accelerated. Programming is a big challenge, not easy in the beginning. But once you’ve got the hang of it and understand the logic, it all becomes clear. From that point onwards everything speeds up. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Dávid Veszelovszki</strong> started coding at the age of six and a half, and he’s been working as a developer since he turned 16. His hobby is travelling. Four years ago, he spent a brief one and a half years exploring Asia and Australia. Now he’s “gone” for another six months—driving around the USA in a red car, accompanied by his girlfriend.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>I live here</strong>: Budapest (but I’m in the Oregon state at the moment)</li>
<li><strong>I work here</strong>: <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">CodeBerry</a> (but I’m on vacation now)</li>
<li><strong>I rock</strong>: web development and living for free</li>
<li><strong>My work style in one word</strong>: efficient</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h4>When you&#8217;re asked about your profession, how do you answer?</h4>
<p>I&#8217;m a travelling Humanities Engineer.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h4>Tell me more about what program you’re developing right now?</h4>
<p>Currently, I’m on vacation, so the answer is nothing. The last thing I’ve worked on was the learning interface of CodeBerry, the virtual “classroom” where students receive their homework. I also have some hobby projects, like the mobile app I developed last to read my old movie critics with. It came in very handy. I still use it regularly.</p>
<h4>How does your workspace look like?</h4>
<p>I didn’t find a picture of my desk, but here’s what my home workspace looks like:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-5820" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/David_Veszelovszki_pic1-3.jpeg" alt=" Engineers at work" width="789" height="442" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The founders of CodeBerry (left to right: Dávid Veszelovszki, Ádám Freisinger, András P. Tóth, László Békéssy)</p>
<h4>When, where, and how did you learn to code?</h4>
<p>I got a 286 PC and a Quick Basic book from my father when I was six; I learned the basics from that. My dad helped me out whenever I got stuck.</p>
<h4>What are the job opportunities for web developers? On average, how much time did you spend looking for a job?</h4>
<p>The opportunities are really great. I don’t think I’ve ever even looked for a full-time job before because something always found me before I had time to search. I usually look for projects, it only takes me a few hours.</p>
<h4>What is your daily, weekly, etc. schedule like?</h4>
<p><strong>My day:</strong> We get up at 8 in the car, eat a Subway sandwich or some fruits for breakfast, brush our teeth, and head somewhere by car or by foot. We look around, take some pictures, cook lunch in the car, and then continue walking or driving and taking pictures. We spend the evening by reading, watching a movie or something alike, and then go to sleep. It doesn’t sound like a packed day but it is. We walk 10k+ steps and I drive ~100 miles each day.</p>
<p><strong>My week</strong>: We work out approximately 5 times a week (and take showers! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ). Once a week I sit down for an hour or two to review the past week and plan the next. Twice or three times a week, we eat some local specialities depending on where we are at the time.</p>
<p><strong>My month</strong>: My past two months were very different from the rest. At the moment, we just keep repeating the things I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p><strong>My year</strong>: Luckily, each year is different. I like the changes. I started 2016 with intensive studying and later we started working on CodeBerry and that took all my time. I then hit the road in July.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12028 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h4></h4>
<h4>What surprised you about this job that you never thought of before?</h4>
<p>Well, this was a long time ago, but I was surprised I could make new games for myself and set new tasks one after another. It’s just like LEGO but with infinite building blocks from the start. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h4>Do you have skills that would surprise everyday people?</h4>
<p>Meditating 10 hours every day for 10 days in a row. I <a href="https://www.dhamma.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">learned</a> this back in 2011 in India, but you can learn it anywhere else for free.</p>
<h4>Who do you work with?</h4>
<p>With my girlfriend, Dóri. We travel together; that’s my current “job”. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h4>What are the typical career paths in your profession?</h4>
<p>Well, if my profession is IT, then the most popular path is to attend university at age 18-24, work 40 years in various places, spend 2-7 years in each place, and retire.<br />
A more unusual way of life—the one I’d like to follow—is to spend less than I make and retire earlier. (Spending all my money while travelling doesn’t really help though. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> )</p>
<h4>What are your plans and how do you wish to continue?</h4>
<p>I’d like to continue working on CodeBerry for a few years. Afterwards, I’ll probably find a similar enterprise because I like entrepreneurship. I usually organize my life around helping people. I want to help them learn a lot in a small amount of time and live a healthy life.</p>
<h4>What other profession would you choose if you had to change? Could you change?</h4>
<p>I’d be glad to work next to a conveyor belt because that’s meditative. Or I’d be part of the cleaning staff to enter places locked away from others. Or a cashier in a local supermarket so that there would be at least one nice cashier in that shop. Or a high school teacher, teaching any subject. Or a carpenter—that must be really cool!<br />
I think I’d be able to do any of those, but programming pays more so I won’t change.</p>
<h4>What skills do great developers, IT experts require? Who do you not recommend this profession to?</h4>
<p>Structured thinking, monotony tolerance and higher than average IQ are required. I don’t recommend it to those who don’t have these qualities or are not interested in IT.</p>
<h4>What’s your favourite part?</h4>
<p>That I can create great value in very little time. And that people appreciate my job. Also, I can work from anywhere.</p>
<h4>What grinds your gears most? What are the difficulties and dangers of your profession?</h4>
<p>The most difficult part is to keep a lot of information in mind all at once. The annoying part is when you don’t have proper tools, e.g. the application you have to use is uncomfortable. The biggest danger is sitting a lot in front of the computer because you can become fat and unhealthy.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12255 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h4></h4>
<h4>How stable is your job? How much time does one spend working for the same company?</h4>
<p>My main job is travelling at the moment. It’s pretty stable for the next four months, but we’ll be heading home shortly after that.</p>
<h4>If you had to ask one thing in the name of all developers, what would it be?</h4>
<p>I would ask why don’t more people want to do this. It’s so cool! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h4>How much can one earn in this profession (as a newbie, experienced and veteran)?</h4>
<p>In [the US] it’s average [$60k/90k/120k] per [year] as a software developer.</p>
<h4>What do you think is the best way to learn to code?</h4>
<p>Actively and passionately, with the help of free courses, e.g. <a href="http://freecodecamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">freecodecamp</a>. Or if one doesn’t speak very good English, there’s CodeBerry.</p>
<h4>What makes code worth learning?</h4>
<p>If this profession suits you, it’s a challenging and creative job. By the end of the day, you can go to sleep thinking you’ve created something yet again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>László Békéssy</strong> graduated as an electrical engineer and now works as a developer and robot engineer besides being co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">CodeBerry Programming School</a>.

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>I live here</strong>: Budapest, Hungary</em></p>
<p><em><strong>I work here</strong>: CodeBerry Programming School</em></p>
<p><em><strong>I work with</strong>: iPhone, Dell, Windows + my computer’s full of UNIX systems</em></p>
<p><em><strong>My work style in one word</strong>: ready. (It’s hard to describe this in one word because “ready” has a different meaning for everyone. Let me quote Marsellus Wallace: if it’s ready, it’s ready. There’s nothing more to do with it.)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h4><strong>When you&#8217;re asked about your profession, how do you answer?</strong></h4>
<p>I start to philosophize about the meanings of profession, vocation, and work, and I ask back if the person has found his vocation yet. I don’t like to answer this question though because it’s the second most popular small talk after “How’s it going?”, and I prefer deeper conversations than that. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Otherwise, I usually say I’m a school director (CodeBerry) as well as an automation expert, creating automation bots.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h4><strong>Tell me more about what you do regarding programming?</strong></h4>
<p>I automate tasks that occur more than three times.</p>
<p>Within a product (CodeBerry to be precise), clients have long and diverse life cycles. We have to follow them around from the point of arriving on the site and clicking a button.</p>
<p>My task is to make sure an interaction happens when a potential student arrives on our website, of course, in a fully automated way. For example, I ensure:</p>
<ul>
<li>They can register and receive the confirmation emails.</li>
<li>They can pay.</li>
<li>They are measured with analytics.</li>
<li>They receive the correct automatic emails whenever needed.</li>
<li>They receive an invoice.</li>
<li>We can follow which campaign they found us through and which ones work.</li>
<li>They can’t access our sites after deleting their subscription and they receive a refund if requested.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, I perform plenty of other background tasks to make our products as reliable as possible. It isn’t easy to secure that a server meltdown is followed by resetting everything to the exact copy of the old server but it’s a completely automated thing. This way we sleep safe and sound each night.</p>
<h4><strong>How does your workspace look like?</strong></h4>
<p>Mostly I work from a home office, sometimes from a café, but that’s a less comfortable solution. There are three important things by my desk: my laptop (obviously), a pair of headphones (I always listen to music during work, not kidding, always) and two different kinds of chairs (I sit a lot, therefore, swap them from time to time).</p>
<p>I’m planning to invest in a standing desk; it would definitely improve my work style. Oh and there’s often tea or water by my side to make sure I drink and get up more often.</p>

<h4><strong>When, where, and how did you learn to code?</strong></h4>
<p>During IT classes in university. I actually started learning it when I was 14, but I didn’t find it interesting until the end of university when we started learning about self-generating codes and automation robots. If we translate my philosophy in a positive way, I would say I want many IT specialists to work on useful things instead of continuing whatever they do now. If we want to be harsher, we could just say I want to stop the jobs of a lot of IT guys. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h4><strong>What are the job opportunities for web developers? On average, how much time did you spend looking for a job?</strong></h4>
<p>I never looked. Engineers, developers, IT specialists and electrical engineers are always needed. By the way, I have a degree in electrical engineering, with a hint of IT (embedded systems).</p>
<h4><strong>What is your schedule like?</strong></h4>
<p>My typical weekly routine looks something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monday: I spend the whole day with meetings (setting strategy and operative tasks) to get rid of them for the rest of the week.</li>
<li>Tuesday: there’s a long-term strategic discussion in the morning, later I usually meet with whoever I have to.</li>
<li>Wednesday-Thursday: I’m at home all day and nobody bothers me. Sometimes, I work 10-12 hours, although when I have some other things to do, I work “only” 6. These are net durations, excluding lunch, having conversations, or time spent in the bathroom.</li>
<li>Friday: we start with summarizing the week and then we plan the next one. My afternoon tasks vary.</li>
<li>Saturday-Sunday: 80% of the time, they’re free. But, as an entrepreneur, sometimes I just have to work full-time.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is approximately how my last year has passed. I&#8217;m very satisfied with this flexible routine because I’m in charge of my work hours, and I don’t have to travel to an office all the time. I always have a few days when I can work without disturbance. This is every developers’ dream.</p>
<h4><strong>What surprised you about this job that you never thought of before?</strong></h4>
<p>I would never have guessed that one day I’ll end up programming this much. But I’m happy about the opportunity to create things, especially when I work on projects that I’m motivated about from within.</p>
<h4><strong>Is there something you know that would surprise everyday people?</strong></h4>
<p>Sadly people tend to drop the conversation after hearing the words “IT” and “programming”, saying they’re not good at maths. However, I think IT is interesting and not that complex, not to mention that it’s something you can talk about in a way everyone could understand. My friend and I like to compete with each other, trying to explain the most difficult IT-, physics- and maths-related concepts with a cat and a box (inspired by Schrödinger’s cat) to just about anyone. With one exception (convolution), we could manage everything so far. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Steering back to the question, anything I’m interested in regarding IT can surprise (or bore) everyday people.</p>
<p>Especially the automation part:</p>
<p><em>“-Can you do a program that will download all your photos from your phone to your computer, rename them, order them by date, and upload them to the internet?”</em></p>
<p><em>“-Yep, just give me 10 minutes.”</em></p>
<h4><strong>Who do you work with?</strong></h4>
<p>I work with the co-founders of CodeBerry. The team has a history. We’ve been working together for 8 years and we have other favourite projects too: Invisible University, <a href="https://yearcompass.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">YearCompass</a> and SotePedia, just to bring some bigger examples.</p>
<h4><strong>What are the typical career paths in your profession?</strong></h4>
<p>I don’t have a good answer to this question because my weekly tasks usually involve four-five professions. We call these “hats” in the company because, before each task, we declare who’s wearing which hat, meaning what are we ready to do at that moment. Building the company, speaking to the accountant, configuring servers, creating a strategy, or writing codes all require different skills.</p>
<p>Introducing ourselves by declaring our &#8220;hats&#8221; is a funny ritual we do before every meeting. It&#8217;s a fun yet challenging part of entrepreneurship.</p>
<h4><strong>What are your plans, how do you wish to continue?</strong></h4>
<p>We’re focused 100% on CodeBerry at the moment. We’re planning on becoming international so that’s very exciting. The rest lies within the mystery of the future. We’ll see.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12028 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h4><strong>What other profession would you choose if you had to change? Could you change?</strong></h4>
<p>I wouldn’t like to change.</p>
<p>Five years ago I reevaluated important aspects of work. This is what I came up with:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can manage my own time. No need for an entry card system.</li>
<li>I can work on projects I find are worth it and have benefits.</li>
<li>I work with people who perform above expectations.</li>
<li>I work with people who communicate well.</li>
<li>I work on projects with a big impact on others.</li>
<li>My job brings passive income. If I want, I can stop anytime.</li>
<li>My workplace is no more than 15-20 minutes away from my home.</li>
<li>I can work from home if I wish.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, my current job meets all of the above.</p>
<h4><strong>What skills do great developers, IT experts require? Who do you not recommend this profession to?</strong></h4>
<p>I think you can only be good if you like what you’re doing. Luckily by now, programming has become a bit like swimming: you can try it, so do it if you like it, and leave it if you don’t. If you like accounting or serving food, do it; if you don’t, leave it. You know what I mean.</p>
<p>So just give things a go, stretch beyond your capabilities, and then love it or leave it.</p>
<h4><strong>What’s your favourite part?</strong></h4>
<p>Creating, and focusing on things.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, I always listen to music during work because this way it takes me no more than 5 minutes to reach the state where I can concentrate fully on one thing. I listen to female vocal trance, chill step, or progressive trance—they have a tempo similar to my brainwaves.</p>
<h4><strong>What grinds your gears most? What are the difficulties and dangers of your profession?</strong></h4>
<p>Some days, everything is on track. Every line of code I write works, everything is smooth, and I finish all tasks I wanted to. In fact, I complete some extra things too. These are the days I keep a record of in my calendar; there are two of them each year.</p>
<p>The rest are rougher. Twenty percent of my work is effective programming and 80 is more of debugging and testing. In some extreme cases, I turn to the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">StackOverflow</a> community asking for a solution and run their suggested lines without even knowing what they do.</p>
<p>I really don’t recommend this profession to those who don’t like investigating and discovering. These are necessary to find that missing space in the code that stops the whole thing from running properly. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h4><strong>How stable is your job? How much time does one spend working for the same company?</strong></h4>
<p>My job is stable. I’m the boss.</p>
<p>To be honest, I’ve never worked for more than 2-3 years at the same place or on the same project and I’m planning to continue with this tendency.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12255 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h4><strong>If you had to ask for one thing in the name of all developers, what would it be?</strong></h4>
<p>Give programming a go, you might like it. In which case, you’ll probably live a much better life than now.</p>
<h4><strong>How much can one earn in this profession (as a newbie, experienced and veteran)?</strong></h4>
<p>I started my career at a multinational company so I was paid the typical amount at the bottom of those ladders.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t say I’m experienced or a veteran, but with my current knowledge, I would probably be hired for an annual $30,000 wage. This doesn’t have to be a developer job, rather a tech team leader or middle management.</p>
<h4><strong>What do you think is the best way to learn to code?</strong></h4>
<p>Choose a project off your “I should” list (a bucket list of things you should do, but of course you never have time…), and program it.</p>
<h4><strong>What makes code worth learning?</strong></h4>
<p>It’s not worth it unless you really like to do it.</p>
<p>But it’s definitely worth forgetting the thought that you can only be a good developer if you like maths and physics. That’s just not how it works. I have pharmacist, economist, artist and painter friends who like to code. Some of them do it for money, others are motivated by self-fulfilment. You should try it too.</p>
