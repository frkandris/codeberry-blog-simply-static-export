										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Adam Freisinger</strong> finished his studies as a Pharmacist and Health Care Manager, but ended up working as a web developer. Since then he has founded two IT companies. One of them being <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">CodeBerry</a>, a programming school that teaches web development online in english.</p>
<p>Tune in to read more about adventure games written in BASIC, winding copper wires for RAM cores and artificial intelligence. Along with that, we&#8217;ll also discuss the entrepreneur lifestyle of Adam Freisinger.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I live in: </strong>Budapest, Hungary.</p>
<p><strong>I work:</strong> wherever my laptop is / CodeBerry programming school</p>
<p><strong>I work with:</strong> my iPhone, MacBook Air and Sublime Text.</p>
<p>I have an efficient work style.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What do you do for a living?</strong></p>
<p>I help people learn to code.</p>
<p><strong>Tell me more about what you do regarding programming?</strong></p>
<p>I improve <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">lesson content</a> for Codeberry, so they are easier to teach and more comprehensible. This involves less coding and more creative thinking.<br />
In my free time, I fiddle with my hobby projects, that are normally tools for things I’m interested in. Recently I built the following three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>A social playlist for Spotify,</li>
<li>A Chrome extension, that quotes famous books on a new tab,</li>
<li>Software that allows me to organize my projects as well as my CodeBerry goals.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How does your workspace look like?</strong></p>
<p>I feel best in a minimalistic environment, so my desk only contains things I use:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-5810 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Adam_Freisinger_pic1-2.jpeg" alt="That’s the place where the lessons of Codeberry are made" width="800" height="600" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">My workstation (Credit: Adam Freisinger)</p>
<p><strong>When, where and how did you learn to code?</strong></p>
<p>I got a computer when I was in elementary school and my parents thought I needed to know how to use it. So, every week a friend would come over and teach me the fundamentals. I really enjoyed writing my first run-around adventure game in BASIC.</p>
<p>I continued with things I found interesting, like writing a <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/dcplusplus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">DC++</a> chatbot or building a website for my father. When they published the new version of Meteor framework I couldn&#8217;t resist building a web application with it.</p>
<p>Most of my knowledge comes from searching the internet. I would browse a larger topic, then dig deeper into puzzling details.</p>
<p><strong>What are the job opportunities for web developers? On average, how much time did you spend looking for a job?</strong></p>
<p>Due to the fact that I graduated as a Pharmacist and Health Care Manager, I never looked for jobs in programming. I took on some small tasks that found me and lead to bigger tasks. Now, I&#8217;m working in my own company taking on several roles, whatever&#8217;s needed.</p>
<p>Seeing that people regularly contact me on <a href="http://linkedin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="http://upwork.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Upwork</a>, even with very little information available, this is a demanding job.</p>
<p><strong>What is your schedule like?</strong></p>
<p>I like to get up early because it&#8217;s still quiet both inside and out. I plan my day, drink some fruit juice and start working after breakfast. I also go over special events that happened on the previous day.</p>
<p>During a business week, the first one and a half days are dedicated to strategy and Friday is for reviews. Between the two I have time to work without distractions.</p>
<p>I like reviewing my personal life too, my partner and I write down each week things we enjoyed and others that need changing.</p>
<p>Twice a week I try to meet somebody for lunch that I haven&#8217;t seen for a while.</p>
<p>My weeks, months and years are similar to my days. I like to plan at the beginning of each period and look back at the end to attempt to learn from it. Every month, I collect the photos I have taken from the previous month. I also complete the <a href="http://www.yearcompass.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">YearCompass</a> every year.</p>
<p><strong>Is there something you know that would surprise everyday people?</strong></p>
<p>Programming is not magic. It mostly involves internet research. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><strong>Who do you work with?</strong></p>
<p>I work with my friends that I have worked with for eight years on projects like Codeberry.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What are the typical career paths in your profession?</strong></p>
<p>As a Pharmacist, I could have walked a well-defined life path, but I left that certainty behind. Right now, my task is to do things within the company that requires me to reach beyond the limits of what is known.</p>
<p>This gives me the opportunity to constantly learn something new and improve myself. I don&#8217;t have a certain path before me now and it makes me feel like I can become anything I want.</p>
<p><strong>What are your plans, how do you wish to continue?</strong></p>
<p>The expression &#8220;jack of all trades, master of none&#8221; describes my path best. I would like to experience as many things as I can and learn a little about each of them. I am much like a duck wanting to both fly and swim, however, not mastering either of them.</p>
<p>I hope to find a winding path between &#8220;some trades&#8221; and &#8220;all trades.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>What other profession would you choose if you had to change? Could you change?</strong></p>
<p>I wouldn’t want to change.</p>
<p><strong>What skills do great developers, IT experts require? Who do you not recommend this profession to?</strong></p>
<p>There are a few skills that don’t hurt:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strong analytical thinking,</li>
<li>An experimenting spirit,</li>
<li>Attention to details.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What’s your favourite part?</strong></p>
<p>I enjoy seeing fast results. I can change the world by simply editing a code. I would probably be a terrible nuclear power plant designer, who plans something with all their heart then, if lucky, sees the steps of their design begin several years later.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12018 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What grinds your gears most? What are the difficulties and dangers of your profession?</strong></p>
<p>You no longer need to know how to build RAM modules to browse websites. Similarly, there are plenty of pre-written programs that stop you from seeing things further.</p>
<p>It makes me mad when I have to rewrite a login module, instead of taking advantage of pre-defined elements. There are too many different solutions for the same problem, we&#8217;re being inefficient this way.</p>
<p><strong>How stable is your job? How much time does one spend working for the same company?</strong></p>
<p>Right now, I’m pretty sure I would find a job.<br />
I feel lucky because I can afford to work somewhere as long as I can focus on my tasks, improve and learn new things. If this changed, I would want to quit.</p>
<p><strong>If you had to ask for one thing in the name of all developers, what would it be?</strong></p>
<p>Please don’t write the same code twice. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><strong>How much can one earn in this profession (as a newbie, experienced and veteran)?</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to the years spent saving some money, I now have the opportunity to work for my own business. I hope we can afford some paychecks soon, as now only my enthusiasm pushes me forward.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12255 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What do you think is the best way to learn to code?</strong></p>
<p>One answer doesn’t fit all, everyone has to learn the way they can do best. For me, it’s easiest via real projects. Whenever I’m stuck I just seek help.</p>
<p><strong>What makes code worth learning?</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, programming is like a foreign language; it helps understand other cultures and change your entire life if you want it to. Secondly, it’s a profession that surely won’t disappear in the next decades (or until artificial intelligence takes over).</p>
