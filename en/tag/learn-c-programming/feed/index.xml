<h3><b>Uses for C++</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With C++, you can create all kinds of cool things, such as <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/659948/what-are-aaa-triple-a-video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">AAA video games</a>, powerful desktop applications, and mobile apps. As a low-level language, C++ is harder to understand but gives you more control over the hardware. Some even say that C++ programming helps you “get closer to the metal”. This is what makes it the perfect choice for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBRXOZSUw54" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">developing video games</a> for consoles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also use C++ in systems programming, embedded systems, and back-end web development. C++ programming is great for creating or tweaking operating systems and device drivers. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12017 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3><b>What Is C++?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C++ is a general-purpose programming language that builds upon the basics of C, one of the most widely used programming languages of all time. Over the years, C has been gradually replaced by modern improvements upon the language, such as C++ and C#. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C++ was first invented in 1985 by Bjarne Stroustrup, who wanted a faster, more powerful version of the C programming language (created in 1972). Although it contains much of C’s syntax, C++ added new features, such as classes, which makes it capable of object-oriented programming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the C programming language, “++” increases the value of a numeric variable (i.e. 1 would become 2). Bjarne added this to the name of C++ to communicate that this new language was a more advanced, evolved version of C.    </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, C++ holds the place of its predecessor as one of the most popular programming languages today. </span></p>
<h3><b>What Is Programming in C++ Like?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s what the<a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"> basics of C++ programming</a> look like using the “Hello World” example:</span></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code class="language-cpp" lang="cpp">#include &lt;iostream&gt;
int main()
{
  std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, world!\n";
}</code></pre>
<h3><strong>How Much Do C++ Programmers Make?</strong></h3>
<p>According to data from<a class="rank-math-link" href="https://www.indeed.com/career/c%2B%2B-developer/salaries?from=top_sb" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"> indeed.com</a>, C++ developers in the United States, who have worked in their positions for 1-3 years, make an average of $116,115 per year, which is $9676.25 per month before taxes. This, of course, includes many salaries from expensive areas such as San Francisco and New York where salaries are inflated for the cost of living.</p>

</div>
<h3><strong>How Do I Learn C++?</strong></h3>
<p>C++ programming is known as a rather complex and difficult-to-learn language. For this reason, many programmers choose to start by learning HTML, CSS, and a programming language like JavaScript. That way, they can start their coding career in Web Development and learn C++ along the way while they’re already making money and gaining programming experience. </p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1357" class="wp-image-8697" src="https://i2.wp.com/codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/robot-507811_1920-1.jpg?fit=1024%2C724&amp;ssl=1" alt="C++ programming helps you “get closer to the metal”

<h3><strong>If you’d like to take the challenge to learn C++, there are a few steps you’ll want to take:</strong></h3>
<p>The first step is to enrol in a Computer Science program at your local university. As a low-level programming language, you’ll want to know most of the underlying concepts of computer programming before starting C++. </p>
<p>However, you’ll also have to spend plenty of time outside the classroom, since a Computer Science program is more often focused on teaching you concepts rather than skills. </p>
<p>Therefore, the second step to learning C++ programming is finding good print and <a class="rank-math-link" href="https://www.learncpp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">digital resources</a> you can study in your free time. There are plenty of books and manuals available out there that can teach you <a class="rank-math-link" href="http://cplusplus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">how to program in C++</a>, as well as online classes and tutorials. Because C++ has been around for such a long time, you might even find some good books on programming C++ at your local library.</p>
<p>The third step is to seek out online communities, forums, and message boards where you can get help from more experienced C++ programmers. Continue to practice and ask the community whenever you get stuck and can’t figure out a solution yourself. Websites like Cplusplus.com have forums where users actively discuss related topics and answer questions.</p>
<h3><strong>How Long Does it Take to Learn C++ programming?</strong></h3>
<p>The amount of time it takes to learn a programming language depends on the methods you use, your learning retention, and how many hours you invest per week. You can’t expect to know everything about C++ programming after taking a semester-long course at your local university or a 14-week program at a coding bootcamp. </p>
<p>If you already have a background in C programming, you can probably expect to spend about 3 or 4 months learning the additional features of C++. However, if you’re starting from scratch with this language, you will probably spend over 6 months to learn it at the most basic level. </p>
<p>To learn C++ at a high enough level to get a C++ programming job would most likely take you 3-4 years. Unfortunately, even C++ programmers with decades of experience still regard it as one of the most difficult languages to write. </p>

<h3><strong>Is C++ Right for Me?</strong></h3>
<p>To determine if a programming language is right for you, you first need to figure out how it lines up with your long-term goals. </p>
<p>Learning C++ programming isn’t for the faint of heart. It will undoubtedly take you years of study and practice. So, you should definitely be sure of your decision before embarking upon this long journey. </p>
<p>Since you probably won’t be able to learn C++ without any previous background in programming, we recommend beginners start with more basic languages like HTML, CSS, and, JavaScript.</p>

<h3><b>Uses for C# programming language</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C# is an object-oriented programming language that is primarily used for developing desktop, mobile, and web-based applications for Windows and other Microsoft products. By using the .NET framework, you can develop nearly anything for Microsoft with C#. Although the .NET framework supports a wide variety of programming languages, such as VB.NET, C++, and F#, C# is the most popular of the bunch. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>What Exactly Is .NET?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To better understand C# programming, we’ll first need to address .NET, the framework that goes hand in hand with this programming language. Developed by Microsoft, the .NET framework contains a huge number of class libraries (pre-written code) to help developers create applications faster and more efficiently. Because both C# and .NET are products of Microsoft, it’s not very common to see one mentioned without the other. There are, however, a few other frameworks that are used with C#, such as Unity.</span></p>
<h3><b>Game Development in Unity</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://unity.com/learn/get-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Unity</a> is a framework for C# that is specifically designed for creating video games. Today, Unity is the most widely-used game engine, with over a third of top-selling games having been built with it. Unity is also currently used for the development of most VR games. Approximately 90% of all Samsung Gear and 53% of all Oculus Rift games have been developed with Unity. </span></p>

<h3><b>Web Development</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the main benefits of choosing C# as your go-to programming language is being able to use Microsoft’s huge library of tools for web development. Through ASP.NET (a part of the .NET framework), one can develop websites, web pages, and other web applications with C#.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_8742" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8742" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-8742" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/configure-web-app-project-framework-1024x711.png" alt="With ASP.NET you can develop C#-based websites" width="1024" height="711" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/configure-web-app-project-framework-1024x711.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/configure-web-app-project-framework-300x208.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/configure-web-app-project-framework-768x533.png 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/configure-web-app-project-framework.png 1026w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-8742" class="wp-caption-text">With ASP.NET you can develop C#-based websites</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although C# and .NET tend to go hand in hand, it’s not necessary to use the framework to program with C#. They simply work well together, due to being developed by Microsoft. </span></p>
<h3><b>Mobile Development </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to the .NET framework, you can develop mobile applications for Windows, iOS, and Android with C#. While previously limited to just Windows phone development, Microsoft recently opened up the .NET framework to cross-platform development, due to the commercial failure of the Windows phone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than stay dedicated to Windows phone and see their mobile development tools fail along with it, Microsoft decided it would be better to allow iOS and Android developers to use Visual Studio. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_8743" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8743" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-8743" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Codelane2x-600x450-1.png" alt="That’s how developing looks like in VisualStudio" width="600" height="450" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Codelane2x-600x450-1.png 600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Codelane2x-600x450-1-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-8743" class="wp-caption-text">That’s how developing looks like in VisualStudio</p></div></p>
<h3><b>Cross-Platform Development</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although they are unaffiliated with Microsoft, third-party IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) like <a href="https://www.monodevelop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">MonoDevelop</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/get-started/installation/windows" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Xamarin Studios</a> allow you to use C# and the .NET framework to develop for Mac OS and Linux. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of this added capability, C# programming can now be used to develop just about anything on any platform, from Xbox and Android to Mac OS and Web. </span></p>
<h3><b>What Is C#?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the year 2000, Anders Hejlsberg at Microsoft developed C# to compete with Java, which was created by Sun Microsystems. Despite having much in common with Java, Hejlsberg stated that C# had much more in common with C++. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pronounced as “C-Sharp,” the name “C#” comes from the musical notation that indicates making a note one semitone higher in pitch. C# also resembles C++++ with the plus symbols being arranged in a 2&#215;2 grid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following in the footsteps of other modern programming languages like Java and C++, C# is a general-purpose, object-oriented language that aims to deliver both simplicity and performance. </span></p>
<h3><b>What Is Programming in C# Like?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s what C# code looks like using the “Hello World” example:</span></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code class="language-csharp" lang="csharp">using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!");
    }
}</code></pre>
<h3><strong>How Much Do C# Programmers Make?</strong></h3>
<p>Because the .NET framework allows you to create a wide variety of programs, the salary of a C# developer can vary depending on their area of expertise. For example, a C# developer who creates websites and web apps may make much less than a software engineer or senior .NET developer, although they both use C#. </p>
<p>According to data from <a class="rank-math-link" href="https://www.indeed.com/career/.net-developer/salaries" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">indeed.com,</a> C# developers in the United States make an average of $67,970 per year, which is $5664.17 per month before taxes and have worked in their current position for 1-4 years. This, of course, includes many salaries from expensive areas such as San Francisco and New York where salaries are inflated for cost of living.</p>
<h3><strong>How Do I Learn C#?</strong></h3>
<p>There are a variety of paths you can take towards learning C#, such as online courses, university programs, and coding bootcamps.</p>
<h4><em>Online Courses</em></h4>
<p>One of the best (and cheapest) ways to learn C# is directly from Microsoft themselves. Through<a class="rank-math-link" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/virtual-academy/9wzdncrdk13l" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"> Microsoft’s Virtual Academy</a>, you can learn how to program in C# and use the .NET framework for free with their series of tutorial videos and resources. </p>
<p>Just visit Microsoft’s page to start watching the tutorials and follow along. You can even get certification from Microsoft Virtual Academy that you can place on your resume. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12028 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><em>University</em></h4>
<p>As we often tell our students, a university education will always give you a broader picture and teach you the underlying concepts of programming. However, studying Computer Science doesn’t guarantee that you’ll know how to code upon graduation. </p>
<p>During your 4 years in university, you’ll spend the majority of your time learning about mathematics, electronics, and the fundamentals of how computer languages work. If you want to learn a specific language, such as C#, you’ll still have to invest your own personal time into studying it.  </p>
<h4><em>Coding Bootcamps</em></h4>
<p>For those of you who are interested in skipping a formal education and pursuing a career right away, online courses and bootcamps provide a much more accelerated learning path. They also focus on teaching you the skills you need to perform your job, rather than fully understanding every line of code.   </p>
<h3><strong>How Long Does it Take to Learn C# programming for beginners?</strong></h3>
<p>Just like any skill, the time it takes to learn a certain programming language can vary greatly from person to person. If you already have a background in coding, you can expect to take anywhere from 2 to 3 months to learn the very basic of C# programming. </p>
<p>Building the skills and knowledge you need to get a job as a developer, on the other hand, will take you around 1 to 2 years of practice. </p>
<p>Unlike web development languages, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it’s difficult to absorb all of the content needed to get a job as a C# developer in one concentrated, 14-week course. For this reason, it’s much less common to find coding bootcamps that teach C#. </p>
<p>And while a coding bootcamp will definitely teach you a lot about C#, it’s recommended that you take additional time to study and practice before launching yourself into a career as a C# or .NET developer.  </p>

<h3><strong>Is C# Right for Me?</strong></h3>
<p>Before deciding whether or not to learn a programming language, it’s always best to first figure out how it lines up with your long-term goals. </p>
<p>C# is considered by many programmers as a rather difficult language to learn, making it a less-than-optimal choice for first-time coders. This isn’t to say that it’s impossible to learn from scratch, but it does carry a rather steep learning curve. </p>
<p>Because you’ll want to have previous experience with programming before learning C#, we would recommend that beginners start with more basic languages, like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. </p>
<p>To learn if C# is a good fit for you, please check out our article, “<a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/which-programming-language-is-right-for-you/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Which Programming Language is Right for Me?</a>”.
