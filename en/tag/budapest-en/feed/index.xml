<li class="entry-title"><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/interview-tips-that-will-give-you-confidence-and-help-you-land-a-dev-job/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Interview tips that will give you confidence and help you land a dev job</a></li>

</ul>
<h3><b>Before you learn to code, think about what you want to code</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing how to code is mostly about building things, and the path is a lot clearer when you have a sense of the end goal. If your goal is “learn to code,” without a clear idea of the kinds of programs you will write and how they will make your life better, you will probably find it a frustrating exercise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m a little ashamed to admit that part of my motivation for studying computer science was that I wanted to prove I was smart, and I wanted to be able to get Smart Person jobs. I also liked thinking about math and theory (</span><a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Godel-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this book</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> blew my mind at an impressionable age) and the program was a good fit. It wasn’t enough to sustain me for long, though, until I found ways to connect technology to the things I really loved, like music and literature.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what do you want to code? Websites? Games? iPhone apps? A startup that makes you rich? Interactive art? Do you want to be able to impress your boss or automate a tedious task so you can spend more time looking at otter pictures? Perhaps you simply want to be more employable, add a buzzword to your resume, or fulfill the requirements of your educational program. All of these are worthy goals. Make sure you know which one is yours, and study accordingly.</span></p>
<h3><b>There’s nothing mystical about it</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coding is a skill like any other. Like language learning, there’s grammar and vocabulary to acquire. Like math, there are processes to work through specific types of problems. Like all kinds of craftsmanship and art-making, there are techniques and tools and best practices that people have developed over time, specialized to different tasks, that you’re free to use or modify or discard.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/ThePerilsofJavaSchools.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This guy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (a very smart guy! Whose other writings I enjoy and frequently agree with!) posits that there is a bright line between people with the True Mind of a Programmer and everyone else, who are lacking the intellectual capacity needed to succeed in the field. That bright line consists, according to him, of pointers and recursion (there are primers </span><a href="http://alumni.cs.ucr.edu/~pdiloren/C++_Pointers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://inventwithpython.com/blog/2011/08/11/recursion-explained-with-the-flood-fill-algorithm-and-zombies-and-cats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the curious).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I learned about pointers and recursion in school, and when I understood them, it was a delightful jolt to my brain — the kind of intellectual pleasure that made me want to study computer science in the first place. But, outside of classroom exercises, the number of times I’ve had to be familiar with either concept to get things done has been relatively small. And when helping others learn, over and over again, I’ve watched people complete interesting and rewarding projects without knowing anything about either one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no point in being intimidated or wondering if you’re Smart Enough. Sure, the more complex and esoteric your task, the higher the level of mastery you will need to complete it. But this is true in absolutely every other field. Unless you’re planning to make your living entirely by your code, chances are you don’t have to be a recursion-understanding genius to make the thing you want to make.</span></p>
<h3><b>It never works the first time</b></h3>
<h4><b>And probably won’t the second or third time</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you first start learning to code, you’ll very quickly run up against this particular experience: you think you’ve set up everything the way you’re supposed to, you’ve checked and re-checked it, and it still. doesn’t. work. You don’t have a clue where to begin trying to fix it, and the error message (if you’re lucky enough to have one at all) might as well say “fuck you.” You might be tempted to give up at this point, thinking that you’ll never figure it out, that you’re not cut out for this. I had that feeling the first time I tried to write a program in C++, ran it, and got only the words “segmentation fault” for my trouble.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this experience is so common for programmers of all skill levels that it says absolutely nothing about your intelligence, tech-savviness, or suitability for the coding life. It will happen to you as a beginner, but it will also happen to you as an experienced programmer. The main difference will be in how you respond to it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve found that a big difference between new coders and experienced coders is faith: faith that things are going wrong for a logical and discoverable reason, faith that problems are fixable, faith that there is a way to accomplish the goal. The path from “not working” to “working” might not be obvious, but with patience you can usually find it.</span></p>
<h3><b>Someone will always tell you you’re doing it wrong</b></h3>
<p><a href="http://theprofoundprogrammer.com/page/17" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Braces should go on the next line</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/2782" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Braces should go on the same line</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="http://derkarl.org/why_to_tabs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use tabs to indent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TabsAreEvil" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But tabs are evil</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You should </span><a href="http://mysqlstoredprocedure.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=51&amp;Itemid=40" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">use stored procedures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but actually </span><a href="http://www.tonymarston.co.uk/php-mysql/stored-procedures-are-evil.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you shouldn’t use them</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You should </span><a href="http://www.lanoie.net/classes/DHTML/programming/lectures/lecture.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">always comment your code</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But </span><a href="http://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2013/06/01/roc-rocks.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">good code doesn’t need comments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are almost always many different approaches to a particular problem, with no single “right way.” A lot of programmers get very good at advocating for their preferred way, but that doesn’t mean it’s the One True Path. Going head-to-head with people telling me I was Wrong, and trying to figure out if they were right, was one of the more stressful aspects of my early career.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re coding in a team with other people, someone will almost certainly take issue with something that you’re doing. Sometimes they’ll be absolutely correct, and it’s always worth investigating to see whether you are, in fact, Doing It Wrong. But sometimes they will be full of shit or re-enacting an ancient and meaningless dispute where it would be best to just follow a style guide and forget about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, if you’re the kind of person who enjoys ancient but meaningless disputes (grammar nerds, I’m looking at you), you’ve come to the right place.</span></p>

<h3><b>Someone will always tell you you’re not a real coder</b></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/prog.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HTML isn’t real coding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="http://the-shaolin.blogspot.ca/2007/12/why-vi-only-true-programmers-editor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t use vi, you’re not really serious</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="http://www.ericsink.com/entries/c_morse_code.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real programmers know C</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="http://www.zazzle.ca/real_coders_dont_do_windows_tees-235789605999466863" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real coders don’t do Windows.</span></a> <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/07/separating-programming-sheep-from-non-programming-goats.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some people will never be able to learn it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/05/please-dont-learn-to-code.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You shouldn’t learn to code</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2013/08/21/chase-felker-youre-not-a-computer-programmer-and-thats-ok/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re not a computer programmer (but I am)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Coding” means a lot of different things to a lot of different people, and it looks different now from how it used to. And, funnily enough, the tools and packages and frameworks that make it faster and easier for newcomers or even trained developers to build things are most likely to be tarred with the “not for REAL coders” brush. (See: “</span><a href="http://blog.enfranchisedmind.com/2009/04/return-of-the-real-programmer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Return of the Real Programmer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">”)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behind all this is the fear that </span><a href="http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2013/08/21/chase-felker-youre-not-a-computer-programmer-and-thats-ok/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">if “anyone” can call themselves a programmer, the title will become meaningless</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But I think that this gatekeeping is destructive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the tools that make it easiest to build the things you want to build. If that means your game was made in Stencyl or GameMaker rather than written from scratch, that’s fine. If your first foray into coding is HTML or Excel macros, that’s fine. Work with something you feel you can stick with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you get more comfortable, you’ll naturally start to find those tools limiting rather than helpful and look for more powerful ones. But most of the time, few people will ever even look at your code or even ask what you used — It’s what you make with it that counts.</span></p>
<h3><b>Worrying about “geek cred” will slowly kill you</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">See above. I used to worry a lot, especially in school, about whether I was identifying myself as “not a real geek” (and therefore less worthy of inclusion in tech communities) through my clothing, my presentation, my choice of reading material and even my software customization choices. It was a terrible waste of energy and I became a lot more functional after I made the decision to let it all go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to internalize this: your ability to get good at coding has </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">nothing</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to do with how well you fit into the various geek subcultures. This goes double if you know deep down that you’ll never quite fit. The energy you spend proving yourself should be going into making things instead. And, if you’re an indisputable geek with cred leaking from your eye sockets, keep this in mind for when you’re evaluating someone else’s cred level. It may not mean what you think it does.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-7777 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/business-3560932_1920-3.jpg" alt="With a few advice i'ts always easier to learn, how to code" width="1920" height="1280" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/business-3560932_1920-3.jpg 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/business-3560932_1920-3-300x200.jpg 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/business-3560932_1920-3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/business-3560932_1920-3-768x512.jpg 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/business-3560932_1920-3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/business-3560932_1920-3-1080x720.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<h3><b>Sticking with it is more important than the method</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no shortage of articles about the “right” or “best” way to learn how to code, and there are lots of potential approaches. You can learn the concepts </span><a href="http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">from a book</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or by </span><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">completing interactive exercises</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or by </span><a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/intro.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">debugging things that others have written</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And, of course, there are lots of languages you might choose as your first to learn, with advocates for each.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A common complaint with “teach yourself to code” programs and workshops is that you’ll breeze happily through the beginner material and then hit a steep curve where things get more difficult very quickly. You know how to print some lines of text on a page but have no idea where to start working on a “real,” useful project. You might feel like you were just following directions without really understanding and blame the learning materials.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12255 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you get to this stage, most of the tutorials and online resources available to you are much less useful because they assume you’re already an experienced and comfortable programmer. The difficulty is further compounded by the fact that “you don’t know what you don’t know.” Even trying to figure out what to learn next is a puzzle in itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll hit this wall no matter what “learn to code” program you follow, and the only way to get past it is to persevere. This means you keep trying new things, learning more information, and figuring out, piece by piece, how to build your project. You’re a lot more likely to find success in the end if you have a clear idea of why you’re learning to code in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you keep putting bricks on top of each other, it might take a long time but eventually, you’ll have a wall. This is where that faith I mentioned earlier comes in handy. If you believe that with time and patience you can figure the whole coding thing out, in time you almost certainly will. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Balázs Gergely Soós</strong>, BeeGee is a graduate computer science engineer with a PhD from the PPKE Multidisciplinary Doctoral School of Sciences and Technology, also an alumni member of the BME Schönherz College &#8211; and now also a student of <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">CodeBerry</a>. He formerly worked for SZTAKI as a research assistant, was a research engineer at Searchlab, senior developer and founder of Streamnovation and leader programmer at Zinemath.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I live here</strong>: Budapest, Hungary</p>
<p><strong>I work here</strong>: MorganStanley</p>
<p><strong>Time spent studying with <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">CodeBerry</a></strong>: 3 months</p>
<p><strong>I work with</strong>:HP ENVY, Samsung Galaxy S4 mini, Chrome, <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Notepad++</a>, <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/gitk" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">gitk</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h4>When you&#8217;re asked about your profession, how do you answer?</h4>
<p>I’m a software developer.</p>
<h4>What was your job before you started coding? Did you have any former experience in this field?</h4>
<p>When I was a child I used to look for swapped O’s and zeros in BASIC programs. I gave up an aircraft modelling workshop to draw with a Commodore+4 and I was often fiddling with GV-Basic (C64) too. I used Tubo Pascal in high school and <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/beginners-guide-to-c/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">C++</a> at university among other interesting languages. <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/beginners-guide-to-c/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">C++</a> stuck with me for quite a long time… and then machine vision, robotics and GPU programming came along.</p>
<h4>Why did you decide to start learning web development?</h4>
<p>In my opinion desktop applications are done for. Instead, I was interested in mobile development and cloud services. I wanted to learn WebGL after coming across it for the first time. I thought the first step should be recalling my web knowledge, as I had previously dealt with some <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/beginners-guide-to-php/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">PHP</a> and MySQL, but the frontend was always done by someone else. Many of my projects focused on calculation, not the interface. However, I became curious about the tricks done by <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/g/gui.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">GUI wizards</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h4>Please tell us more about what you do now, what tasks you have? What happens on a typical day?</h4>
<p>I work in a bank, so that’s a secret. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> But my job includes some daily frontend tasks.</p>
<h4>How long were you looking for a job? How did you land your current position?</h4>
<p>My previous one was like a dream job: a real dreamer mastermind, fantastic engineers, international exhibitions and a rock-solid investor. But one day I felt like it was all too much. I needed some peace and quiet to be able to hear some new voices and finally have time for my family and myself.</p>
<p>This impulse hit me in the summer. My wife had 4 weeks off, so we moved to Venice for the time. Relaxing by the lakeside made me realise how much I’m missing some intellectual activity, so I started studying…</p>
<p>Two months later I had a couple of interviews. When the news of me not working got around, one of my dorm fellows called me and said if I still love those special program languages and I’m interested in big databases, then he has an empty desk for me by his side…</p>
<h4>How did you learn programming? What kind of courses, books etc. did you use?</h4>
<p>I don’t remember anymore, it just happened. I possessed a few issues with Computerbooks. The next thing was university: György Pongor and Zoltán László. After that, I kept to online materials.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8548" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/home-office-336373_1920-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="As a Codeberry student you can learn everywhere" width="1024" height="683" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/home-office-336373_1920-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/home-office-336373_1920-1-300x200.jpg 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/home-office-336373_1920-1-768x512.jpg 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/home-office-336373_1920-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/home-office-336373_1920-1-1080x720.jpg 1080w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/home-office-336373_1920-1.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h4>&#8220;What did CodeBerry offer you? What was it like to study at our school?</h4>
<p>I read about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Node.js</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_(web_framework)" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Angular</a> and could feel the power of their combination. During my doctorate years, I fell in love with independent research, the joy of discovering something new. On the other hand, I do respect teachers who gave me a good kickstart before the journey. Learning out of blogs is really like being in a big city without a map: there are dozens of buses, many tramlines and a few undergrounds. Sometimes you need help with the directions if you actually want to get somewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/andras-p-toth-serial-entrepreneur/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Andris</a> and I meet each other every month. He told me about CodeBerry when it was just a twinkle in his eye. Later <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/web-development-story-of-arpad-binecz/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Bini</a> said he likes the idea. I thought: why not? I was probably one of the first twenty applicants. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Before it wasn’t my job to make something pretty. At the beginning of the lessons, the focus was on the frontend. I didn’t regret that though. It was very useful to be able to try everything I just learned and test my knowledge with quizzes. By the time I completed a WordPress site, CSS and I became great friends.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12255 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h4>Do you have any experience, tips or tricks to share with those who are just starting their studies?</h4>
<p>You just have to sit down and do it… I got the final push from a friend of mine: he asked me to create a responsive website for him. He took advantage of me not working at the time. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h4>What is the next step for you? What direction are you taking?</h4>
<p>As soon as I&#8217;ll have a few spare weekends, I&#8217;ll steer back to my original goal, WebGL. Maybe Spiced up with some VR.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Márton Radnóczi</strong>, Marci is an agronomist specialised in rural development. He&#8217;s been passionate about web and mobile related products from day one, finally last year he decided to devote more time to them. He now works at Apertus Ltd. as a sitebuilder.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I live here:</strong> Budapest, Hungary</p>
<p><strong>I work here:</strong> Apertus Ltd.</p>
<p><strong>Time spent studying with CodeBerry:</strong> 6 months</p>
<p><strong>I work with:</strong> Oneplus One, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">PhpStorm</a>, Adobe*</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>When you&#8217;re asked about your profession, how do you answer?</strong></h3>
<p>Briefly: I’m a site builder or web developer. I build websites without a function. My task is to convert sketches into code, so the desired design appears in the browser.</p>
<h3><strong>What did you do for a living before you started coding? Did you have any relevant experience in this field?</strong></h3>
<p>I worked in finance before I became a project manager in a startup. I&#8217;ve never learned to code, I just had an idea of how things worked and what logic they followed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12018 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Why did you decide to start <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/a-brief-introduction-to-web-development/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">studying web development</a>?</strong></h3>
<p>It always appealed to me as a hobby. Time flew by when I started digging into related topics, I felt unstoppable. It was an unmistakable flow experience I&#8217;ve never experienced before during work. I liked the thought of doing this full-time. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h3><strong>Tell me a little about where you work now, what your duties are. What do you do on a typical day or week?</strong></h3>
<p>We develop various size web systems at Apertus Ltd. As a site builder, my role is to create a static page out of a specified design or just simple sketches. Most of the time I get a few pictures that guide my code. I work on numerous projects simultaneously, but normally I focus on just one each day.</p>
<h3><strong>How long were you looking for a job? Was it hard to find a place to work?</strong></h3>
<p>I searched for 1 week, so I admit it was surprisingly easy. I suspected it would be fast, but not this fast though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>How did you learn programming? What kind of courses, books etc. did you use?</strong></h3>
<p>I only enrolled in online courses. First, I tested myself on free materials and then I paid for two that complemented each other. I also watched tutorials on Youtube to gain a deeper insight into some interesting topics.</p>
<h3><strong>What did CodeBerry offer you? What was it like to study at our school?</strong></h3>
<p>The biggest advantage of CodeBerry is that it gives an overview of the whole process of web development, guiding you step by step through all the different stages. This helps you decide which part of it fits you most.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Do you have any experience, tips or tricks to share with those who are just starting their studies?</strong></h3>
<p>Web development has many different areas, it’s worth choosing a few to focus on, and just briefly know the others. If you ever need more, you can always learn it then.</p>
<h3><strong>What is the next step for you? What direction are you taking?</strong></h3>
<p>I would like to learn as much as possible and bring some of my own ideas to life. I’ve never let go of my agricultural knowledge, it will be exciting to see how it might come together with IT.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Árpád Binecz</strong> (Bini) started as an embedded software engineer, worked at a startup, founded his own company and now, with a twist, he’s creating websites as a junior site builder. Enjoy our interview with one of our former students in the second episode of &#8220;<a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/category/codeberry-student-stories/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">CodeBerry Student Stories&#8221;.</a></p>
<h3><strong>What was your job before you shifted to web development?</strong></h3>
<p>I have a degree in electrical engineering. I worked as an embedded software engineer at an automotive company for four years. I also worked at a startup as well as starting my own leisure time managing company that I&#8217;ve since sold.</p>
<h3><strong>What does an embedded software engineer do?</strong></h3>
<p>An embedded software engineer develops circuits, not for computers, but rather for microwaves or cars. These circuits make things happen with a push of a button.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>Did your original profession make studying any easier?</strong></h3>
<p>Quite a bit, e.g. in algorithmic thinking.</p>
<h3><strong>Why did you decide to switch to web development?</strong></h3>
<p>First of all, I was really interested in IoT (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Internet of Things – ed.</a>) I knew the tools pretty well due to my original profession, but I had no idea how things would appear in a browser. I was curious. After all, I studied to become an engineer because I like understanding things. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Secondly, I would like to continue entrepreneurship and this topic seems just right for that: by starting with some unique websites than creating a small digital agency. A lot of people did the same thing in my environment and it looks like an accomplishable and rather cool path to walk.</p>
<h3><strong>When you&#8217;re asked about your profession, how do you answer?</strong></h3>
<p>Depends on who’s asking — someone laic or a friend of mine from tech school. In the first case, I’m an IT newbie. Otherwise, a junior site builder.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12018 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3>What does that mean? How does your typical day pass?</h3>
<p>We develop big IT systems at Apertus Kft.; I’m responsible for a small part of that. Keeping it simple: I receive ready designs and turn them into websites. I work on the looks, but for example, a clickable button is not my job.</p>
<p>To be a bit metaphoric, this is how I would describe the site builder profession: it’s a great jumpstart, with a kind of knowledge that sticks fast and makes it possible to stand with two feet on the quaggy ground of web technologies as well as the IT labor market.</p>
<h3><strong>Which languages do you use daily?</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/a-brief-introduction-to-web-development/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">HTML5, CSS3, SCSS, and Bootstrap.</a> I also used JQuery once. As a site builder, I create the pieces that the lead developer then uses to complete the website.</p>

<h3><strong>Do you enjoy your job? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong></h3>
<p>Yes. My colleagues are fun. I’m just a little unsatisfied with myself because I feel I could do better and learn faster.</p>
<h3><strong>How long did you spend looking for a job?</strong></h3>
<p>I left my previous job in June, started studying in July, and was working by the beginning of September. I got an offer through friends.</p>
<h3><strong>Did you use anything else than CodeBerry for your studies?</strong></h3>
<p>No, only CodeBerry.</p>

<h3><strong>Can you give advice to newbies as a former student?</strong></h3>
<p>I think it’s worth having an overview of the whole field before choosing a technology and diving deep into that. It’s enough to know the smallest sellable unit thoroughly instead of knowing a little bit of everything.</p>
<p>For instance, HTML5, CSS3, SCSS and Bootstrap are a great combo. You can easily become a junior developer with those.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Dávid Veszelovszki</strong> started coding at the age of six and a half, and he’s been working as a developer since he turned 16. His hobby is travelling. Four years ago, he spent a brief one and a half years exploring Asia and Australia. Now he’s “gone” for another six months—driving around the USA in a red car, accompanied by his girlfriend.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>I live here</strong>: Budapest (but I’m in the Oregon state at the moment)</li>
<li><strong>I work here</strong>: <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">CodeBerry</a> (but I’m on vacation now)</li>
<li><strong>I rock</strong>: web development and living for free</li>
<li><strong>My work style in one word</strong>: efficient</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h4>When you&#8217;re asked about your profession, how do you answer?</h4>
<p>I&#8217;m a travelling Humanities Engineer.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h4>Tell me more about what program you’re developing right now?</h4>
<p>Currently, I’m on vacation, so the answer is nothing. The last thing I’ve worked on was the learning interface of CodeBerry, the virtual “classroom” where students receive their homework. I also have some hobby projects, like the mobile app I developed last to read my old movie critics with. It came in very handy. I still use it regularly.</p>
<h4>How does your workspace look like?</h4>
<p>I didn’t find a picture of my desk, but here’s what my home workspace looks like:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-5820" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/David_Veszelovszki_pic1-3.jpeg" alt=" Engineers at work" width="789" height="442" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The founders of CodeBerry (left to right: Dávid Veszelovszki, Ádám Freisinger, András P. Tóth, László Békéssy)</p>
<h4>When, where, and how did you learn to code?</h4>
<p>I got a 286 PC and a Quick Basic book from my father when I was six; I learned the basics from that. My dad helped me out whenever I got stuck.</p>
<h4>What are the job opportunities for web developers? On average, how much time did you spend looking for a job?</h4>
<p>The opportunities are really great. I don’t think I’ve ever even looked for a full-time job before because something always found me before I had time to search. I usually look for projects, it only takes me a few hours.</p>
<h4>What is your daily, weekly, etc. schedule like?</h4>
<p><strong>My day:</strong> We get up at 8 in the car, eat a Subway sandwich or some fruits for breakfast, brush our teeth, and head somewhere by car or by foot. We look around, take some pictures, cook lunch in the car, and then continue walking or driving and taking pictures. We spend the evening by reading, watching a movie or something alike, and then go to sleep. It doesn’t sound like a packed day but it is. We walk 10k+ steps and I drive ~100 miles each day.</p>
<p><strong>My week</strong>: We work out approximately 5 times a week (and take showers! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ). Once a week I sit down for an hour or two to review the past week and plan the next. Twice or three times a week, we eat some local specialities depending on where we are at the time.</p>
<p><strong>My month</strong>: My past two months were very different from the rest. At the moment, we just keep repeating the things I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p><strong>My year</strong>: Luckily, each year is different. I like the changes. I started 2016 with intensive studying and later we started working on CodeBerry and that took all my time. I then hit the road in July.</p>

<h4></h4>
<h4>What surprised you about this job that you never thought of before?</h4>
<p>Well, this was a long time ago, but I was surprised I could make new games for myself and set new tasks one after another. It’s just like LEGO but with infinite building blocks from the start. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h4>Do you have skills that would surprise everyday people?</h4>
<p>Meditating 10 hours every day for 10 days in a row. I <a href="https://www.dhamma.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">learned</a> this back in 2011 in India, but you can learn it anywhere else for free.</p>
<h4>Who do you work with?</h4>
<p>With my girlfriend, Dóri. We travel together; that’s my current “job”. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h4>What are the typical career paths in your profession?</h4>
<p>Well, if my profession is IT, then the most popular path is to attend university at age 18-24, work 40 years in various places, spend 2-7 years in each place, and retire.<br />
A more unusual way of life—the one I’d like to follow—is to spend less than I make and retire earlier. (Spending all my money while travelling doesn’t really help though. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> )</p>
<h4>What are your plans and how do you wish to continue?</h4>
<p>I’d like to continue working on CodeBerry for a few years. Afterwards, I’ll probably find a similar enterprise because I like entrepreneurship. I usually organize my life around helping people. I want to help them learn a lot in a small amount of time and live a healthy life.</p>
<h4>What other profession would you choose if you had to change? Could you change?</h4>
<p>I’d be glad to work next to a conveyor belt because that’s meditative. Or I’d be part of the cleaning staff to enter places locked away from others. Or a cashier in a local supermarket so that there would be at least one nice cashier in that shop. Or a high school teacher, teaching any subject. Or a carpenter—that must be really cool!<br />
I think I’d be able to do any of those, but programming pays more so I won’t change.</p>
<h4>What skills do great developers, IT experts require? Who do you not recommend this profession to?</h4>
<p>Structured thinking, monotony tolerance and higher than average IQ are required. I don’t recommend it to those who don’t have these qualities or are not interested in IT.</p>
<h4>What’s your favourite part?</h4>
<p>That I can create great value in very little time. And that people appreciate my job. Also, I can work from anywhere.</p>
<h4>What grinds your gears most? What are the difficulties and dangers of your profession?</h4>
<p>The most difficult part is to keep a lot of information in mind all at once. The annoying part is when you don’t have proper tools, e.g. the application you have to use is uncomfortable. The biggest danger is sitting a lot in front of the computer because you can become fat and unhealthy.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12255 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h4></h4>
<h4>How stable is your job? How much time does one spend working for the same company?</h4>
<p>My main job is travelling at the moment. It’s pretty stable for the next four months, but we’ll be heading home shortly after that.</p>
<h4>If you had to ask one thing in the name of all developers, what would it be?</h4>
<p>I would ask why don’t more people want to do this. It’s so cool! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h4>How much can one earn in this profession (as a newbie, experienced and veteran)?</h4>
<p>In [the US] it’s average [$60k/90k/120k] per [year] as a software developer.</p>
<h4>What do you think is the best way to learn to code?</h4>
<p>Actively and passionately, with the help of free courses, e.g. <a href="http://freecodecamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">freecodecamp</a>. Or if one doesn’t speak very good English, there’s CodeBerry.</p>
<h4>What makes code worth learning?</h4>
<p>If this profession suits you, it’s a challenging and creative job. By the end of the day, you can go to sleep thinking you’ve created something yet again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>András P. Tóth</strong> studied computer science engineering at Budapest University of Technology and now works as a serial entrepreneur in the IT sector. He&#8217;s currently building <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">CodeBerry Programming School</a> with his friends. They hope to decrease the shortage of IT professionals in Hungary.</p>
<p>During the interview, Andris told us the story of his first [$110] salary and his first company sale as well as the cats of Instagram and the path lying in front of Hungarian developers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I live here</strong>: Budapest, Hungary.</p>
<p><strong>I work here</strong>: mostly at home, sometimes from internet cafés.</p>
<p><strong>I use</strong>: iPhone | MacBook Air | <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Sublime Text</a> | <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">bash</a> | PHP | <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Node.js</a> | <a href="https://mailchimp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Mailchimp</a> | Google</p>
<p><strong>My work style in a few words</strong>: small steps every day.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>When you&#8217;re asked about your profession, how do you answer?</h4>
<p>I usually say I build enterprises. If I see confusion, I add that I create enterprises in the IT sector. My job is to give other people jobs.</p>
<h4>Tell me more about what you do regarding programming?</h4>
<p>Normally I’m occupied by several different projects at once – some are for-profit (like CodeBerry Programming School), some are non-profit ones (e.g. Invisible University, <a href="http://yearcompass.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">YearCompass</a>). Sometimes, I just code to relax.</p>
<p>We started CodeBerry Programming School in 2016 with a few friends. We teach programming to people who’ve never done it before and help them find a job. Among other various tasks, I have plenty of things to do as a developer at this company:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m one of the code mentors who help students with technical things.</li>
<li>I write lots of code for our website as well as places where it connects to other software, like surveys, analytics and payment solutions.</li>
<li>I create modules for the system dealing with the programming homework, like admin statistics, badges, progression indicators.</li>
</ul>
<p>I relax by programming different little things I find interesting at that given moment. Some of my recent projects include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instagram script that gained followers for <a href="https://www.instagram.com/safranektheordinarycat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">our cat’s Instagram</a>.</li>
<li>Slack bot that creates photos of every teammate.</li>
<li>Temperature graph (with data collected by sensors).</li>
<li>Chrome plugin that shares the view of the webcam with another computer.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4></h4>
<h4>When, where and how did you learn to code?</h4>
<p>I was 10 years old when we got a C64 for Christmas. I learned programming with the help of books and friends. We had a little team captivated by the demoscene subculture, we all wanted to create art. We drew, composed music, programmed and, of course, competed with each other.</p>
<p>My first paid job was creating a webshop for an Italian company when I was sixteen. With the help of a dial-up internet connection, I would go online each night and attempt putting together a working website from code snippets I found on the internet. I was 18 when I applied to university where I studied computer science engineering.</p>
<p>In my third year, I started working as a developer and project manager. A year later I created my first company.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>How does your workspace look like?</h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>What are the job opportunities for web developers? On average, how much time did you spend looking for a job?</h4>
<p>I have never looked for a job before. Until the middle of my university studies, people always approached me with developer jobs and, after that, I always worked for my own company. I still get emails via LinkedIn every other week, asking if I’m interested in developer jobs, so I think the market is pretty open to us.</p>
<h4>What is your daily, weekly, yearly schedule like?</h4>
<p>Usually, I get up between 6:30 and 7:30 in the morning, depending on meetings. I work out, take a shower, have breakfast, and work until midday. I have lunch with someone, then work again until five, and then I try and relax.</p>
<p>Mostly, I work from home, so sometimes I doze off in the afternoon, but that results in late-night work. That is not good for anyone.</p>
<p>Most of the times I apply the Pomodoro technique to my work—25 minutes of work followed by a 5-minute rest filled with some chores.</p>
<p>We have operative discussions on Monday and strategic discussions every Tuesday morning. Tuesday to Thursday we all work from our home offices, and Friday we organize live or online meetings to summarize the week.</p>
<p>My job is rather diverse—a part of it is communication (insider conversations, outsider meetings, and code mentoring), a part of it is marketing (managing ads, writing copy, and getting marketing systems to work), and some of it is technical (all kinds of programming tasks).</p>
<p>Four times a year, I take a week off. I also have a few day trips with my colleagues twice a year.<br />
The Invisible University causes two weeks every six months to be rather packed (at the beginning and the end of each semester), and the YearCompass results in an intensive December and January. These make me accept fewer other jobs in these periods.</p>
<h4>What surprised you about this job that you never thought of before?</h4>
<p>Time flies when you program. I start solving a problem and two blinks later it’s already night time. This really surprised me first.</p>
<p>The other thing is the speed with which the whole programming knowledge evolves. I occupied myself with marketing for a few years and when I returned to programming, I could hardly understand what my colleagues were talking about.</p>
<p>It must have been a similar feeling to what elderly people experience when their children try to explain things they can’t catch up with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Do you have skills that would surprise everyday people?</h4>
<p>When somebody asks for help from us (e.g. “the internet is down” or “the printer doesn’t work”), we usually don’t know the solution right away either. All we do is patiently read the error message and find the answer on the internet.</p>
<h4>Who do you work with?</h4>
<p>I work alone a lot. We have weekly meetings, and chat each day with colleagues, if we work on tasks together. I also exchange emails with suppliers, partners, consultants, and the press frequently.</p>
<h4>What are the typical career paths in your profession?</h4>
<p>I think there are a few pronounced paths for IT professionals:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can choose the size and style of the company: freelancer, startup, small business, medium business, multinational and governmental companies.</li>
<li>You can choose a topic: operating, developing, planning, testing or even management, sales, support, growth, data, etc.</li>
<li>You’re distinct by your experience: entry-level, junior, senior, etc.<br />
and within each path, there are many specific junctions (e.g. a developer could be an Angular specialist front-end web developer)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can choose to navigate through these routes all through your life.</p>
<p>I see many examples among my friends too:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s popular to go from zero to infinite on the programming path.</li>
<li>There are plenty of “I started as an IT specialist but found out I was good with people, so I became manager” situations.</li>
<li>There are a few “I started at multinational companies, but I’m trying to build my own business”.</li>
<li>And few of my friends start off with running their own company in the first place.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What are your plans, how do you wish to continue?</h4>
<p>I’m over my first company sale (“Gyümölcstárhely”, a web hosting service was my first company, that was bought by one of Europe’s biggest hosting companies) and many failed projects too. So far, I really enjoyed this entrepreneur-developer combination, so it’s probably what I’m going to continue.</p>
<h4>What other profession would you choose if you had to change? Could you change?</h4>
<p>I wouldn’t change. I really enjoy teaching, so I can imagine doing some kind of consultant-trainer thing. I could probably change to a normal IT job and possibly marketing due to my entrepreneurship experience.</p>
<h4>What skills do great developers, IT experts require? Who do you not recommend this profession to?</h4>
<p>I find the following skills important:</p>
<ul>
<li>Engagement in details – it’s pretty difficult to code in a superficial style. You have to pay attention to the details.</li>
<li>The capability of concentration – finding a single error sometimes takes hours.</li>
<li>Proper English skills – if I’m stuck, I can only find help on the internet in English.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t recommend this profession if you don’t have these skills.</p>
<h4>What’s your favourite part?</h4>
<p>I love programs you can leave running for hours, days or weeks, doing something useful. Creating something that works is also a great feeling.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12255 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h4>What grinds your gears most? What are the difficulties and dangers of your profession?</h4>
<p>The &#8220;professional religious wars&#8221; are both annoying and entertaining. Seeing people fight over text editors and whether you should format code with tabs or spaces&#8230;</p>
<p>It’s not easy to keep up with the constantly changing technology—deciding on which program language to use or which new tool is good enough to be learned.</p>
<p>Plus, there are dangers in this profession:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sitting all day – you need some extra effort if you don’t want to end up being a fat geek.</li>
<li>The bubble – it’s easy to think a company packed with IT professionals are all well-paid 20-50-year old men who understand programming jokes.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How stable is your job? How much time does one spend working for the same company?</h4>
<p>I work in a startup. There are faster-changing projects, undeveloped processes, and bigger uncertainty compared to a bigger, well-functioning company. I worked for 5-6 years in my previous companies; we always started new ones after that.</p>
<p>I have never heard of an IT professional being fired among my friends. Some are more loyal and work decades at the same company, while others change every few years, motivated by higher wages and more interesting roles.</p>
<h4>If you had to ask for one thing in the name of all developers, what would it be?</h4>
<p>As an IT specialist, I would ask, please read the error messages and Google them before you call us.</p>
<p>As an entrepreneur, I wish for clear and understandable emails when seeking help after something goes wrong—what have they tried, what did they expect and what happened instead—and we’ll think of the solution together.</p>
<h4>How much can one earn in this profession (as a newbie, experienced and veteran)?</h4>
<p>In my experience as an entrepreneur:</p>
<ul>
<li>I didn’t make a penny during the first year. I only fed the project with my money.</li>
<li>The first month after the tipping point I could pay myself $110. Later my salary slowly grew to $15,000.</li>
<li>I gained a bigger amount by selling my company. Enough to cover all expenses in the next 4-5 years, letting me focus on my next project.</li>
</ul>
<p>My developer friends usually make more than that. Most of the time, they have a secrecy agreement, so we can only speak of approximates: they make $15,000-30,000 in Hungary, more as a leader, and well over $70,000 in the West. It’s worth browsing <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Glassdoor</a>; they have a lot of info about salaries.</p>
<h4>What do you think is the best way to learn to code?</h4>
<p>There are a lot of great online and offline courses. We collected these on a website: http://programozastanfolyam.com./</p>
<p>The following things helped me the most:</p>
<ul>
<li>Actually having to type the solution to a given task (instead of reading it in a book or watching a video about it)</li>
<li>Specific projects that I could finish (e.g. I’ll build a site for a friend or a project)</li>
<li>A friend or mentor who already knew how to code and could help me when I had problems.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What makes code worth learning?</h4>
<p>For me, programming:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lets me experience creating something.</li>
<li>Offers job opportunities and stable financial support.</li>
<li>Is relaxing.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>László Békéssy</strong> graduated as an electrical engineer and now works as a developer and robot engineer besides being co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">CodeBerry Programming School</a>. During the interview, we gained insights about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-modifying_code" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">self-writing codes,</a> projects Laci fell in love with, prejudices he experienced in IT, and why he thinks total freedom is important at work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>I live here</strong>: Budapest, Hungary</em></p>
<p><em><strong>I work here</strong>: CodeBerry Programming School</em></p>
<p><em><strong>I work with</strong>: iPhone, Dell, Windows + my computer’s full of UNIX systems</em></p>
<p><em><strong>My work style in one word</strong>: ready. (It’s hard to describe this in one word because “ready” has a different meaning for everyone. Let me quote Marsellus Wallace: if it’s ready, it’s ready. There’s nothing more to do with it.)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h4><strong>When you&#8217;re asked about your profession, how do you answer?</strong></h4>
<p>I start to philosophize about the meanings of profession, vocation, and work, and I ask back if the person has found his vocation yet. I don’t like to answer this question though because it’s the second most popular small talk after “How’s it going?”, and I prefer deeper conversations than that. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Otherwise, I usually say I’m a school director (CodeBerry) as well as an automation expert, creating automation bots.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h4><strong>Tell me more about what you do regarding programming?</strong></h4>
<p>I automate tasks that occur more than three times.</p>
<p>Within a product (CodeBerry to be precise), clients have long and diverse life cycles. We have to follow them around from the point of arriving on the site and clicking a button.</p>
<p>My task is to make sure an interaction happens when a potential student arrives on our website, of course, in a fully automated way. For example, I ensure:</p>
<ul>
<li>They can register and receive the confirmation emails.</li>
<li>They can pay.</li>
<li>They are measured with analytics.</li>
<li>They receive the correct automatic emails whenever needed.</li>
<li>They receive an invoice.</li>
<li>We can follow which campaign they found us through and which ones work.</li>
<li>They can’t access our sites after deleting their subscription and they receive a refund if requested.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, I perform plenty of other background tasks to make our products as reliable as possible. It isn’t easy to secure that a server meltdown is followed by resetting everything to the exact copy of the old server but it’s a completely automated thing. This way we sleep safe and sound each night.</p>
<h4><strong>How does your workspace look like?</strong></h4>
<p>Mostly I work from a home office, sometimes from a café, but that’s a less comfortable solution. There are three important things by my desk: my laptop (obviously), a pair of headphones (I always listen to music during work, not kidding, always) and two different kinds of chairs (I sit a lot, therefore, swap them from time to time).</p>
<p>I’m planning to invest in a standing desk; it would definitely improve my work style. Oh and there’s often tea or water by my side to make sure I drink and get up more often.</p>

<h4><strong>When, where, and how did you learn to code?</strong></h4>
<p>During IT classes in university. I actually started learning it when I was 14, but I didn’t find it interesting until the end of university when we started learning about self-generating codes and automation robots. If we translate my philosophy in a positive way, I would say I want many IT specialists to work on useful things instead of continuing whatever they do now. If we want to be harsher, we could just say I want to stop the jobs of a lot of IT guys. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h4><strong>What are the job opportunities for web developers? On average, how much time did you spend looking for a job?</strong></h4>
<p>I never looked. Engineers, developers, IT specialists and electrical engineers are always needed. By the way, I have a degree in electrical engineering, with a hint of IT (embedded systems).</p>
<h4><strong>What is your schedule like?</strong></h4>
<p>My typical weekly routine looks something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monday: I spend the whole day with meetings (setting strategy and operative tasks) to get rid of them for the rest of the week.</li>
<li>Tuesday: there’s a long-term strategic discussion in the morning, later I usually meet with whoever I have to.</li>
<li>Wednesday-Thursday: I’m at home all day and nobody bothers me. Sometimes, I work 10-12 hours, although when I have some other things to do, I work “only” 6. These are net durations, excluding lunch, having conversations, or time spent in the bathroom.</li>
<li>Friday: we start with summarizing the week and then we plan the next one. My afternoon tasks vary.</li>
<li>Saturday-Sunday: 80% of the time, they’re free. But, as an entrepreneur, sometimes I just have to work full-time.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is approximately how my last year has passed. I&#8217;m very satisfied with this flexible routine because I’m in charge of my work hours, and I don’t have to travel to an office all the time. I always have a few days when I can work without disturbance. This is every developers’ dream.</p>
<h4><strong>What surprised you about this job that you never thought of before?</strong></h4>
<p>I would never have guessed that one day I’ll end up programming this much. But I’m happy about the opportunity to create things, especially when I work on projects that I’m motivated about from within.</p>
<h4><strong>Is there something you know that would surprise everyday people?</strong></h4>
<p>Sadly people tend to drop the conversation after hearing the words “IT” and “programming”, saying they’re not good at maths. However, I think IT is interesting and not that complex, not to mention that it’s something you can talk about in a way everyone could understand. My friend and I like to compete with each other, trying to explain the most difficult IT-, physics- and maths-related concepts with a cat and a box (inspired by Schrödinger’s cat) to just about anyone. With one exception (convolution), we could manage everything so far. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Steering back to the question, anything I’m interested in regarding IT can surprise (or bore) everyday people.</p>
<p>Especially the automation part:</p>
<p><em>“-Can you do a program that will download all your photos from your phone to your computer, rename them, order them by date, and upload them to the internet?”</em></p>
<p><em>“-Yep, just give me 10 minutes.”</em></p>
<h4><strong>Who do you work with?</strong></h4>
<p>I work with the co-founders of CodeBerry. The team has a history. We’ve been working together for 8 years and we have other favourite projects too: Invisible University, <a href="https://yearcompass.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">YearCompass</a> and SotePedia, just to bring some bigger examples.</p>
<h4><strong>What are the typical career paths in your profession?</strong></h4>
<p>I don’t have a good answer to this question because my weekly tasks usually involve four-five professions. We call these “hats” in the company because, before each task, we declare who’s wearing which hat, meaning what are we ready to do at that moment. Building the company, speaking to the accountant, configuring servers, creating a strategy, or writing codes all require different skills.</p>
<p>Introducing ourselves by declaring our &#8220;hats&#8221; is a funny ritual we do before every meeting. It&#8217;s a fun yet challenging part of entrepreneurship.</p>
<h4><strong>What are your plans, how do you wish to continue?</strong></h4>
<p>We’re focused 100% on CodeBerry at the moment. We’re planning on becoming international so that’s very exciting. The rest lies within the mystery of the future. We’ll see.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12028 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h4><strong>What other profession would you choose if you had to change? Could you change?</strong></h4>
<p>I wouldn’t like to change.</p>
<p>Five years ago I reevaluated important aspects of work. This is what I came up with:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can manage my own time. No need for an entry card system.</li>
<li>I can work on projects I find are worth it and have benefits.</li>
<li>I work with people who perform above expectations.</li>
<li>I work with people who communicate well.</li>
<li>I work on projects with a big impact on others.</li>
<li>My job brings passive income. If I want, I can stop anytime.</li>
<li>My workplace is no more than 15-20 minutes away from my home.</li>
<li>I can work from home if I wish.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, my current job meets all of the above.</p>
<h4><strong>What skills do great developers, IT experts require? Who do you not recommend this profession to?</strong></h4>
<p>I think you can only be good if you like what you’re doing. Luckily by now, programming has become a bit like swimming: you can try it, so do it if you like it, and leave it if you don’t. If you like accounting or serving food, do it; if you don’t, leave it. You know what I mean.</p>
<p>So just give things a go, stretch beyond your capabilities, and then love it or leave it.</p>
<h4><strong>What’s your favourite part?</strong></h4>
<p>Creating, and focusing on things.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, I always listen to music during work because this way it takes me no more than 5 minutes to reach the state where I can concentrate fully on one thing. I listen to female vocal trance, chill step, or progressive trance—they have a tempo similar to my brainwaves.</p>
<h4><strong>What grinds your gears most? What are the difficulties and dangers of your profession?</strong></h4>
<p>Some days, everything is on track. Every line of code I write works, everything is smooth, and I finish all tasks I wanted to. In fact, I complete some extra things too. These are the days I keep a record of in my calendar; there are two of them each year.</p>
<p>The rest are rougher. Twenty percent of my work is effective programming and 80 is more of debugging and testing. In some extreme cases, I turn to the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">StackOverflow</a> community asking for a solution and run their suggested lines without even knowing what they do.</p>
<p>I really don’t recommend this profession to those who don’t like investigating and discovering. These are necessary to find that missing space in the code that stops the whole thing from running properly. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h4><strong>How stable is your job? How much time does one spend working for the same company?</strong></h4>
<p>My job is stable. I’m the boss.</p>
<p>To be honest, I’ve never worked for more than 2-3 years at the same place or on the same project and I’m planning to continue with this tendency.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12255 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h4><strong>If you had to ask for one thing in the name of all developers, what would it be?</strong></h4>
<p>Give programming a go, you might like it. In which case, you’ll probably live a much better life than now.</p>
<h4><strong>How much can one earn in this profession (as a newbie, experienced and veteran)?</strong></h4>
<p>I started my career at a multinational company so I was paid the typical amount at the bottom of those ladders.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t say I’m experienced or a veteran, but with my current knowledge, I would probably be hired for an annual $30,000 wage. This doesn’t have to be a developer job, rather a tech team leader or middle management.</p>
<h4><strong>What do you think is the best way to learn to code?</strong></h4>
<p>Choose a project off your “I should” list (a bucket list of things you should do, but of course you never have time…), and program it.</p>
<h4><strong>What makes code worth learning?</strong></h4>
<p>It’s not worth it unless you really like to do it.</p>
<p>But it’s definitely worth forgetting the thought that you can only be a good developer if you like maths and physics. That’s just not how it works. I have pharmacist, economist, artist and painter friends who like to code. Some of them do it for money, others are motivated by self-fulfilment. You should try it too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Adam Freisinger</strong> finished his studies as a Pharmacist and Health Care Manager, but ended up working as a web developer. Since then he has founded two IT companies. One of them being <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">CodeBerry</a>, a programming school that teaches web development online in english.</p>
<p>Tune in to read more about adventure games written in BASIC, winding copper wires for RAM cores and artificial intelligence. Along with that, we&#8217;ll also discuss the entrepreneur lifestyle of Adam Freisinger.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I live in: </strong>Budapest, Hungary.</p>
<p><strong>I work:</strong> wherever my laptop is / CodeBerry programming school</p>
<p><strong>I work with:</strong> my iPhone, MacBook Air and Sublime Text.</p>
<p>I have an efficient work style.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What do you do for a living?</strong></p>
<p>I help people learn to code.</p>
<p><strong>Tell me more about what you do regarding programming?</strong></p>
<p>I improve <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">lesson content</a> for Codeberry, so they are easier to teach and more comprehensible. This involves less coding and more creative thinking.<br />
In my free time, I fiddle with my hobby projects, that are normally tools for things I’m interested in. Recently I built the following three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>A social playlist for Spotify,</li>
<li>A Chrome extension, that quotes famous books on a new tab,</li>
<li>Software that allows me to organize my projects as well as my CodeBerry goals.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How does your workspace look like?</strong></p>
<p>I feel best in a minimalistic environment, so my desk only contains things I use:</p>

<p><strong>When, where and how did you learn to code?</strong></p>
<p>I got a computer when I was in elementary school and my parents thought I needed to know how to use it. So, every week a friend would come over and teach me the fundamentals. I really enjoyed writing my first run-around adventure game in BASIC.</p>
<p>I continued with things I found interesting, like writing a <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/dcplusplus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">DC++</a> chatbot or building a website for my father. When they published the new version of Meteor framework I couldn&#8217;t resist building a web application with it.</p>
<p>Most of my knowledge comes from searching the internet. I would browse a larger topic, then dig deeper into puzzling details.</p>
<p><strong>What are the job opportunities for web developers? On average, how much time did you spend looking for a job?</strong></p>
<p>Due to the fact that I graduated as a Pharmacist and Health Care Manager, I never looked for jobs in programming. I took on some small tasks that found me and lead to bigger tasks. Now, I&#8217;m working in my own company taking on several roles, whatever&#8217;s needed.</p>
<p>Seeing that people regularly contact me on <a href="http://linkedin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="http://upwork.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Upwork</a>, even with very little information available, this is a demanding job.</p>
<p><strong>What is your schedule like?</strong></p>
<p>I like to get up early because it&#8217;s still quiet both inside and out. I plan my day, drink some fruit juice and start working after breakfast. I also go over special events that happened on the previous day.</p>
<p>During a business week, the first one and a half days are dedicated to strategy and Friday is for reviews. Between the two I have time to work without distractions.</p>
<p>I like reviewing my personal life too, my partner and I write down each week things we enjoyed and others that need changing.</p>
<p>Twice a week I try to meet somebody for lunch that I haven&#8217;t seen for a while.</p>
<p>My weeks, months and years are similar to my days. I like to plan at the beginning of each period and look back at the end to attempt to learn from it. Every month, I collect the photos I have taken from the previous month. I also complete the <a href="http://www.yearcompass.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">YearCompass</a> every year.</p>
<p><strong>Is there something you know that would surprise everyday people?</strong></p>
<p>Programming is not magic. It mostly involves internet research. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><strong>Who do you work with?</strong></p>
<p>I work with my friends that I have worked with for eight years on projects like Codeberry.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What are the typical career paths in your profession?</strong></p>
<p>As a Pharmacist, I could have walked a well-defined life path, but I left that certainty behind. Right now, my task is to do things within the company that requires me to reach beyond the limits of what is known.</p>
<p>This gives me the opportunity to constantly learn something new and improve myself. I don&#8217;t have a certain path before me now and it makes me feel like I can become anything I want.</p>
<p><strong>What are your plans, how do you wish to continue?</strong></p>
<p>The expression &#8220;jack of all trades, master of none&#8221; describes my path best. I would like to experience as many things as I can and learn a little about each of them. I am much like a duck wanting to both fly and swim, however, not mastering either of them.</p>
<p>I hope to find a winding path between &#8220;some trades&#8221; and &#8220;all trades.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>What other profession would you choose if you had to change? Could you change?</strong></p>
<p>I wouldn’t want to change.</p>
<p><strong>What skills do great developers, IT experts require? Who do you not recommend this profession to?</strong></p>
<p>There are a few skills that don’t hurt:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strong analytical thinking,</li>
<li>An experimenting spirit,</li>
<li>Attention to details.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What’s your favourite part?</strong></p>
<p>I enjoy seeing fast results. I can change the world by simply editing a code. I would probably be a terrible nuclear power plant designer, who plans something with all their heart then, if lucky, sees the steps of their design begin several years later.</p>

<p><strong>What grinds your gears most? What are the difficulties and dangers of your profession?</strong></p>
<p>You no longer need to know how to build RAM modules to browse websites. Similarly, there are plenty of pre-written programs that stop you from seeing things further.</p>
<p>It makes me mad when I have to rewrite a login module, instead of taking advantage of pre-defined elements. There are too many different solutions for the same problem, we&#8217;re being inefficient this way.</p>
<p><strong>How stable is your job? How much time does one spend working for the same company?</strong></p>
<p>Right now, I’m pretty sure I would find a job.<br />
I feel lucky because I can afford to work somewhere as long as I can focus on my tasks, improve and learn new things. If this changed, I would want to quit.</p>
<p><strong>If you had to ask for one thing in the name of all developers, what would it be?</strong></p>
<p>Please don’t write the same code twice. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><strong>How much can one earn in this profession (as a newbie, experienced and veteran)?</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to the years spent saving some money, I now have the opportunity to work for my own business. I hope we can afford some paychecks soon, as now only my enthusiasm pushes me forward.</p>

<p><strong>What do you think is the best way to learn to code?</strong></p>
<p>One answer doesn’t fit all, everyone has to learn the way they can do best. For me, it’s easiest via real projects. Whenever I’m stuck I just seek help.</p>
<p><strong>What makes code worth learning?</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, programming is like a foreign language; it helps understand other cultures and change your entire life if you want it to. Secondly, it’s a profession that surely won’t disappear in the next decades (or until artificial intelligence takes over).</p>
