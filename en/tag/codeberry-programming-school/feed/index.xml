										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Landing those first few developer roles in your career can be hard.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you convince someone to hire you when you have limited experience? What things are critical to know? What if you get asked a question you don’t know the answer to?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> need to know </span><a href="https://twitter.com/ppk/status/963850873003757569" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">how to write a &lt;link&gt; tag from scratch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Spoiler: you don’t).</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve been working as a web developer for about a decade. I’ve held various roles in companies of all shapes and sizes — from global tech companies to small local agencies. I’ve been interviewed more times than I can count, and I’ve had more rejections than successes. As I have progressed to more senior positions, I increasingly find myself on the other side of the table.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m going to share some things that I look for when I’m interviewing new candidates. Perhaps more importantly, they are things that have helped me feel more confident when I’m the one being interviewed.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The technical requirements of any given role will vary, so I won’t be giving you any suggestions about addressing those. There are plenty of articles with titles like </span><b>“10 Things Every Modern Web Developer Must Know”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You can use those to guide (or more likely, overwhelm) you.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What I am going to suggest, overall, is that you shouldn’t fret about the things you </span><b>don’t know</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>1. Be comfortable with your experience and abilities</b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking about your experience is usually the starting point for an interview. It’s also usually the first thing on your CV. Showing your experience and how you’ve applied your skills and abilities is a fundamental part of any interview process.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s normal to feel the pressure of making a good first impression. As such, it can be tempting to oversell yourself and your abilities, or to exaggerate the importance of a project you have worked on.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But you must remember — you’re not expected to have a wealth of experience or technical ability when starting out. Exaggerating or overselling your experience will create a less than ideal first impression, even if you’re otherwise well-suited for the role. This is something that is true at any point in your career, but it’s an easy trap to fall into when you’re starting out.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s much better to simply be factual about your experience and ability. Talk about the projects you’ve worked on and your specific role within those projects. Highlight the skills you used and technology you’ve been exposed to while working on them.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show, don’t tell.</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a principle in story-telling that I think also applies to job interviews.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t </span><b>tell</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> your audience what is happening, </span><b>show</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> them with actions and allow them to interpret it and arrive at a conclusion themselves.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if the interviewer can arrive at this conclusion by themselves:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This candidate is experienced with Y, and is clearly passionate about X”.</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is much more valuable than you telling them:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m highly experienced with Y, and very passionate about X”.</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equally as important as not overselling your skills and experience is being able to admit you don’t know something.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12028 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><b>2. Don’t be afraid to say “I don’t know”</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s easy to feel pressured to answer a question you don’t know the answer to. If you do, this is what is likely to happen:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll copy/paste together snippets of information you’ve heard or read and regurgitate whatever comes to mind first. You’ll hope to hit on the right combination of words to answer the question. You’ll stumble, sound incoherent, and get flustered.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let me be as unambiguous about this as possible. Saying “I don’t know” when you don’t know the answer to something is </span><b>always</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the best answer. Don’t pretend to know something you don’t.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re made to feel uncomfortable for saying “I don’t know” in an interview, you should treat that as a red flag. It’s usually a sign of a toxic workplace. You don’t want to work at a company that doesn’t encourage vulnerability.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t know something, always be upfront and admit it. You can always follow up with what you think</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the answer might be. Even better, you can follow up with a question.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t know much about X, but I think it’s related to Y. Can you give me some more detail? Are you using X in your projects?</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often, the answer to your follow up questions will allow you to give a secondary response. Even though you didn’t know the answer, you can show that you understand the context.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12255 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>3. Ask questions. Lots of them.</b><b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asking follow up questions is also a great way to make an interview feel less formal and more like a discussion.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interviewers are often more than happy to talk about their experience with a particular technology, or the challenges they’ve faced on a particular project. This can also help give you insight into why they consider a certain skill or technology to be important for the role.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also remember that an interview is also about you evaluating your potential employer. You can’t properly evaluate them without asking questions.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What project will I be working on? What are some projects this company has recently completed? How large is the team I will be working in? What resources will be available to me for training and personal development?</span></i><br />
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This isn’t only something that is valuable for the interview. Making an objective evaluation of your options is a daily task for a developer. To do that, you need to gather the right information — and to do that, you need to ask questions. Lots of them.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>The candidate with the best technical skills isn’t always the one that gets hired.</b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">My intention here isn’t to sound authoritative about what you should or shouldn’t do in an interview. Nor is it to proclaim that technical skills don’t matter.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, what I am trying to make clear is that learning isn’t linear. You can’t, and won’t, know </span><b>everything</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> required for a role. We all take different paths to get to where we are, and you should be comfortable with that fact.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every role is different, and every organization will have different expectations for their candidates. But, regardless of your skill level, or the expectations of the role, you should:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be comfortable with your current skill level and experience.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Know that it’s acceptable to say “I don’t know”.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feel confident asking questions about things you don’t understand.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I believe these principles are not only essential for doing well in interviews, but can help you succeed in every role you will ever have, at every level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hope there is something you can take away from this article or perhaps you have had success with different strategies.</span></p>

<h3><b>Before you learn to code, think about what you want to code</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing how to code is mostly about building things, and the path is a lot clearer when you have a sense of the end goal. If your goal is “learn to code,” without a clear idea of the kinds of programs you will write and how they will make your life better, you will probably find it a frustrating exercise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m a little ashamed to admit that part of my motivation for studying computer science was that I wanted to prove I was smart, and I wanted to be able to get Smart Person jobs. I also liked thinking about math and theory (</span><a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Godel-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this book</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> blew my mind at an impressionable age) and the program was a good fit. It wasn’t enough to sustain me for long, though, until I found ways to connect technology to the things I really loved, like music and literature.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what do you want to code? Websites? Games? iPhone apps? A startup that makes you rich? Interactive art? Do you want to be able to impress your boss or automate a tedious task so you can spend more time looking at otter pictures? Perhaps you simply want to be more employable, add a buzzword to your resume, or fulfill the requirements of your educational program. All of these are worthy goals. Make sure you know which one is yours, and study accordingly.</span></p>
<h3><b>There’s nothing mystical about it</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coding is a skill like any other. Like language learning, there’s grammar and vocabulary to acquire. Like math, there are processes to work through specific types of problems. Like all kinds of craftsmanship and art-making, there are techniques and tools and best practices that people have developed over time, specialized to different tasks, that you’re free to use or modify or discard.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/ThePerilsofJavaSchools.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This guy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (a very smart guy! Whose other writings I enjoy and frequently agree with!) posits that there is a bright line between people with the True Mind of a Programmer and everyone else, who are lacking the intellectual capacity needed to succeed in the field. That bright line consists, according to him, of pointers and recursion (there are primers </span><a href="http://alumni.cs.ucr.edu/~pdiloren/C++_Pointers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://inventwithpython.com/blog/2011/08/11/recursion-explained-with-the-flood-fill-algorithm-and-zombies-and-cats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the curious).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I learned about pointers and recursion in school, and when I understood them, it was a delightful jolt to my brain — the kind of intellectual pleasure that made me want to study computer science in the first place. But, outside of classroom exercises, the number of times I’ve had to be familiar with either concept to get things done has been relatively small. And when helping others learn, over and over again, I’ve watched people complete interesting and rewarding projects without knowing anything about either one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no point in being intimidated or wondering if you’re Smart Enough. Sure, the more complex and esoteric your task, the higher the level of mastery you will need to complete it. But this is true in absolutely every other field. Unless you’re planning to make your living entirely by your code, chances are you don’t have to be a recursion-understanding genius to make the thing you want to make.</span></p>
<h3><b>It never works the first time</b></h3>
<h4><b>And probably won’t the second or third time</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you first start learning to code, you’ll very quickly run up against this particular experience: you think you’ve set up everything the way you’re supposed to, you’ve checked and re-checked it, and it still. doesn’t. work. You don’t have a clue where to begin trying to fix it, and the error message (if you’re lucky enough to have one at all) might as well say “fuck you.” You might be tempted to give up at this point, thinking that you’ll never figure it out, that you’re not cut out for this. I had that feeling the first time I tried to write a program in C++, ran it, and got only the words “segmentation fault” for my trouble.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this experience is so common for programmers of all skill levels that it says absolutely nothing about your intelligence, tech-savviness, or suitability for the coding life. It will happen to you as a beginner, but it will also happen to you as an experienced programmer. The main difference will be in how you respond to it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve found that a big difference between new coders and experienced coders is faith: faith that things are going wrong for a logical and discoverable reason, faith that problems are fixable, faith that there is a way to accomplish the goal. The path from “not working” to “working” might not be obvious, but with patience you can usually find it.</span></p>
<h3><b>Someone will always tell you you’re doing it wrong</b></h3>
<p><a href="http://theprofoundprogrammer.com/page/17" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Braces should go on the next line</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/2782" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Braces should go on the same line</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="http://derkarl.org/why_to_tabs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use tabs to indent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TabsAreEvil" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But tabs are evil</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You should </span><a href="http://mysqlstoredprocedure.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=51&amp;Itemid=40" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">use stored procedures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but actually </span><a href="http://www.tonymarston.co.uk/php-mysql/stored-procedures-are-evil.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you shouldn’t use them</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You should </span><a href="http://www.lanoie.net/classes/DHTML/programming/lectures/lecture.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">always comment your code</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But </span><a href="http://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2013/06/01/roc-rocks.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">good code doesn’t need comments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are almost always many different approaches to a particular problem, with no single “right way.” A lot of programmers get very good at advocating for their preferred way, but that doesn’t mean it’s the One True Path. Going head-to-head with people telling me I was Wrong, and trying to figure out if they were right, was one of the more stressful aspects of my early career.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re coding in a team with other people, someone will almost certainly take issue with something that you’re doing. Sometimes they’ll be absolutely correct, and it’s always worth investigating to see whether you are, in fact, Doing It Wrong. But sometimes they will be full of shit or re-enacting an ancient and meaningless dispute where it would be best to just follow a style guide and forget about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, if you’re the kind of person who enjoys ancient but meaningless disputes (grammar nerds, I’m looking at you), you’ve come to the right place.</span></p>

<h3><b>Someone will always tell you you’re not a real coder</b></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/prog.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HTML isn’t real coding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="http://the-shaolin.blogspot.ca/2007/12/why-vi-only-true-programmers-editor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t use vi, you’re not really serious</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="http://www.ericsink.com/entries/c_morse_code.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real programmers know C</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="http://www.zazzle.ca/real_coders_dont_do_windows_tees-235789605999466863" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real coders don’t do Windows.</span></a> <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/07/separating-programming-sheep-from-non-programming-goats.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some people will never be able to learn it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/05/please-dont-learn-to-code.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You shouldn’t learn to code</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2013/08/21/chase-felker-youre-not-a-computer-programmer-and-thats-ok/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re not a computer programmer (but I am)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Coding” means a lot of different things to a lot of different people, and it looks different now from how it used to. And, funnily enough, the tools and packages and frameworks that make it faster and easier for newcomers or even trained developers to build things are most likely to be tarred with the “not for REAL coders” brush. (See: “</span><a href="http://blog.enfranchisedmind.com/2009/04/return-of-the-real-programmer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Return of the Real Programmer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">”)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behind all this is the fear that </span><a href="http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2013/08/21/chase-felker-youre-not-a-computer-programmer-and-thats-ok/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">if “anyone” can call themselves a programmer, the title will become meaningless</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But I think that this gatekeeping is destructive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the tools that make it easiest to build the things you want to build. If that means your game was made in Stencyl or GameMaker rather than written from scratch, that’s fine. If your first foray into coding is HTML or Excel macros, that’s fine. Work with something you feel you can stick with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you get more comfortable, you’ll naturally start to find those tools limiting rather than helpful and look for more powerful ones. But most of the time, few people will ever even look at your code or even ask what you used — It’s what you make with it that counts.</span></p>
<h3><b>Worrying about “geek cred” will slowly kill you</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">See above. I used to worry a lot, especially in school, about whether I was identifying myself as “not a real geek” (and therefore less worthy of inclusion in tech communities) through my clothing, my presentation, my choice of reading material and even my software customization choices. It was a terrible waste of energy and I became a lot more functional after I made the decision to let it all go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to internalize this: your ability to get good at coding has </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">nothing</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to do with how well you fit into the various geek subcultures. This goes double if you know deep down that you’ll never quite fit. The energy you spend proving yourself should be going into making things instead. And, if you’re an indisputable geek with cred leaking from your eye sockets, keep this in mind for when you’re evaluating someone else’s cred level. It may not mean what you think it does.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-7777 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/business-3560932_1920-3.jpg" alt="With a few advice i'ts always easier to learn, how to code" width="1920" height="1280" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/business-3560932_1920-3.jpg 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/business-3560932_1920-3-300x200.jpg 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/business-3560932_1920-3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/business-3560932_1920-3-768x512.jpg 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/business-3560932_1920-3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/business-3560932_1920-3-1080x720.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<h3><b>Sticking with it is more important than the method</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no shortage of articles about the “right” or “best” way to learn how to code, and there are lots of potential approaches. You can learn the concepts </span><a href="http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">from a book</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or by </span><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">completing interactive exercises</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or by </span><a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/intro.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">debugging things that others have written</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And, of course, there are lots of languages you might choose as your first to learn, with advocates for each.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A common complaint with “teach yourself to code” programs and workshops is that you’ll breeze happily through the beginner material and then hit a steep curve where things get more difficult very quickly. You know how to print some lines of text on a page but have no idea where to start working on a “real,” useful project. You might feel like you were just following directions without really understanding and blame the learning materials.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12255 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you get to this stage, most of the tutorials and online resources available to you are much less useful because they assume you’re already an experienced and comfortable programmer. The difficulty is further compounded by the fact that “you don’t know what you don’t know.” Even trying to figure out what to learn next is a puzzle in itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll hit this wall no matter what “learn to code” program you follow, and the only way to get past it is to persevere. This means you keep trying new things, learning more information, and figuring out, piece by piece, how to build your project. You’re a lot more likely to find success in the end if you have a clear idea of why you’re learning to code in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you keep putting bricks on top of each other, it might take a long time but eventually, you’ll have a wall. This is where that faith I mentioned earlier comes in handy. If you believe that with time and patience you can figure the whole coding thing out, in time you almost certainly will. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

</ul>
<h3><b>What is programming?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose that you work for a multinational company and you have an upcoming meeting with a businessman from China. Your native language is [insert local language] and you don’t speak a word of Chinese. However, you remember that your second language is English and that the Chinese businessman speaks English as well. You then begin to use English as a common language to negotiate and communicate with each other. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12017 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3><b>What language do computers speak?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A computer’s native language is binary: an incredibly long list of 1’s and 0’s. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Binary</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> isn’t very easy for people to read or write, so we came up with programming languages to talk with computers, instead. Since computers don’t know human languages, we have to meet in the middle somewhere. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, unlike humans, computers aren’t able to pick up on indirect communication and always take things very literally. If you tell them something, they will do it exactly as they are told. Computers aren’t smart enough to make decisions on their own and won’t understand information that isn’t spelt out for them. For this reason, you need to make sure that you’re giving them exact instructions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if I told you to make a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sandwich</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you might ask me what ingredients I want on that sandwich and if I want it toasted or not. To you, that might be all you need to know to make me a delicious sandwich. However, there are many small decisions and previous knowledge involved in making a sandwich. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you simply tell a computer that you want a toasted ham and cheese sandwich with rye bread and mayonnaise, you might get something very different from what you ordered. A human would know that the mayonnaise goes on the slices of bread first, the ham and cheese are added second, then the sandwich is placed in the oven to be toasted. </span></p>
<h3><b>But, how is a computer supposed to know all</b> that?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember that we told the computer that we want, “a toasted ham and cheese sandwich with rye bread and mayonnaise.” To a computer, it might be logical to do all of those things in order. It would toast the ham and cheese by themselves, put two slices of rye bread on top, and then spread mayonnaise on the bread. </span></p>
<h3>Aren’t computers supposed to be smarter than that?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, because the computer takes things</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> literally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you have to specify the order of each step and the placement of each ingredient. Everyone knows that the ingredients go between the pieces of bread, but a computer has no previous knowledge of what a sandwich is like—it’s just following your direct instructions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is another reason why we can’t communicate with computers using human languages, just yet. Our languages are simply too ambiguous and too vague for a computer to understand properly. Also, if a word or a sentence might have a double meaning, a computer wouldn’t know how to interpret it. It needs everything spelt out for it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The truth is that computers aren’t smart at all; they just happen to process information faster than us. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6210" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/code.2-1.jpg" alt="" width="5472" height="3648" /></p>
<h3>What is a programmer and what do they do?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember, you can’t just tell the computer in English what you want. You’ll need a computer programmer to translate for you. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A computer programmer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a person who communicates your ideas and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">instructions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to a computer, making websites, games, and other programs appear on the screen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A programmer could also be defined as a polyglot (one who knows many languages) that specializes in talking to computers. They know exactly what to say and how to say it so that the computer will understand them. If you’ve ever learned another language, you know that each language comes with its own vocabulary, grammar, and set of rules. Computer languages also come with their own way of saying things, called syntax. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a person might understand you if you </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mispronounce</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a word, use the wrong conjugation, or mess up your grammar, a computer is a lot less forgiving with mistakes. As soon as you make a syntax error, the computer will stop listening to you and quit running the program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How rude. </span></p>
<h3>What are you able to accomplish with coding skills?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve ever used a computer, watched videos online, or played video games, it might be hard to believe that all of that comes from just a series of letters and symbols. The ability to process thousands of lines of code per second is the strength of a computer and allows it to follow highly complex instructions and accomplish incredible tasks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s take a look at some of the cool things you can do with code:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create &amp; Design Websites</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Build Mobile Apps</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Develop Desktop Programs</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Develop Video Games</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create &amp; Maintain Databases</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automate Tasks</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solve Complex Problems</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create Artificial Intelligence</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perform Statistical Analysis</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And much more&#8230;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re interested in any of these activities and would like to do them for a living, learning to program is definitely an important skill to have. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12028 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3>What makes coding useful and what is it good for?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we rely more and more on computers in our daily lives, the importance of computer programming and coding continues to grow as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the coming years, nearly all fields will involve computer programming and learning to code will give you an edge in your future career. For example, you can use programming skills in the areas of writing, analysis, management, engineering, software development, and so much more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advocates of programming see learning to code as a universal skill that everyone should have, such as the ability to read and write or perform simple mathematical equations. Many governments around the world believe this as well and have proposed initiatives to teach coding to kids alongside core curriculum in schools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like us, they see coding as the key to staying competitive in a global marketplace. </span></p>
<h3>I already know it’s useful, but what is programming actually like?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average day in the life of a programmer isn’t as glamorous as it might appear in movies or on television shows. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being a programmer requires a lot of concentration, patience, and a self-driven attitude. If you aren’t able to sit down and focus for hours at a time, you might want to reconsider pursuing a career in computer programming. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some programming jobs may require you to work on an irregular schedule and be available to fix bugs and solve problems immediately as they appear. Others may have you work from nine to five o’clock, just like a regular job. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, working as a computer programmer might give you more freedom than your current job allows. A good number of programming jobs are remote, meaning that you can code while at home, at a café, or while you get a tan at the beach—given that the wifi signal reaches that far. </span></p>
<h3>Is programming really right for me?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where the rubber meets the road and where you’ll have to seriously weigh the computer programmer pros and cons. Perhaps, you’ve had an unrealistic idea of what programming is like and haven’t considered that coding is just like any other job out there—it’s still hard work. However, if you meet the following criteria, chances are that you’ll love every second of it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Signs that Programming Isn’t Right for You:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are only motivated by money and aren’t interested in computers at all</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t like to sit down for long periods of time</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your eyes glaze over when you look at a page of code</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are relatively slow at typing and often make many typos</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Signs that Programming IS Right For You:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You describe yourself as both analytical AND creative</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have high attention to detail</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are comfortable working with others and working alone</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have a good basis for understanding written English</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You love problem-solving</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You love to always learn new things</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You adapt well to change</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You like to organize information and automate processes</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>What programming languages do I choose and where do I start?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s go back to the example of our meeting with the Chinese businessman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although English may be useful in a business setting, you might find that you need to learn other languages for different fields. For example, you might want to know French for diplomacy, Greek for philosophy, and German in the field of engineering. Depending on what field you work in, you will choose a specific language to meet your needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You won’t have the time or ability to learn every programming language out there, so you’ll need to be strategic about what languages you will learn. First, you need to determine what your focus is and what languages you need to know to accomplish your personal goals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While technically not programming languages, HTML and CSS are great languages to start with to begin learning the fundamentals of how programming works. HTML and CSS are “text markup languages” which are actually languages that we use to format and organize the text. Without HTML or CSS, your browser wouldn’t know if these words I’m writing are a headline, a paragraph, or a footer. It also wouldn’t know if these words should be bolded, italicized, etc. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even as I write this article, I am using HTML and CSS to help you and your internet browser understand what I have to say. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12019 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3>TL;DR (Too Long; Didn’t Read)</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In summary, programming is a high-paying career that requires patience, dedication, and extremely high attention to detail. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you hate sitting down at a computer and aren’t willing to put in the time to practice, you’ll likely hate programming and give up rather quickly. You also won’t do well if you are motivated by the paycheck and have no interest in the job itself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if you love learning new things, are self-motivated, and have a can-do attitude, you’ll succeed—regardless of your educational background.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Árpád Binecz</strong> (Bini) started as an embedded software engineer, worked at a startup, founded his own company and now, with a twist, he’s creating websites as a junior site builder. Enjoy our interview with one of our former students in the second episode of &#8220;<a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/category/codeberry-student-stories/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">CodeBerry Student Stories&#8221;.</a></p>
<h3><strong>What was your job before you shifted to web development?</strong></h3>
<p>I have a degree in electrical engineering. I worked as an embedded software engineer at an automotive company for four years. I also worked at a startup as well as starting my own leisure time managing company that I&#8217;ve since sold.</p>
<h3><strong>What does an embedded software engineer do?</strong></h3>
<p>An embedded software engineer develops circuits, not for computers, but rather for microwaves or cars. These circuits make things happen with a push of a button.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>Did your original profession make studying any easier?</strong></h3>
<p>Quite a bit, e.g. in algorithmic thinking.</p>
<h3><strong>Why did you decide to switch to web development?</strong></h3>
<p>First of all, I was really interested in IoT (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Internet of Things – ed.</a>) I knew the tools pretty well due to my original profession, but I had no idea how things would appear in a browser. I was curious. After all, I studied to become an engineer because I like understanding things. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Secondly, I would like to continue entrepreneurship and this topic seems just right for that: by starting with some unique websites than creating a small digital agency. A lot of people did the same thing in my environment and it looks like an accomplishable and rather cool path to walk.</p>
<h3><strong>When you&#8217;re asked about your profession, how do you answer?</strong></h3>
<p>Depends on who’s asking — someone laic or a friend of mine from tech school. In the first case, I’m an IT newbie. Otherwise, a junior site builder.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12018 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3>What does that mean? How does your typical day pass?</h3>
<p>We develop big IT systems at Apertus Kft.; I’m responsible for a small part of that. Keeping it simple: I receive ready designs and turn them into websites. I work on the looks, but for example, a clickable button is not my job.</p>
<p>To be a bit metaphoric, this is how I would describe the site builder profession: it’s a great jumpstart, with a kind of knowledge that sticks fast and makes it possible to stand with two feet on the quaggy ground of web technologies as well as the IT labor market.</p>
<h3><strong>Which languages do you use daily?</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/a-brief-introduction-to-web-development/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">HTML5, CSS3, SCSS, and Bootstrap.</a> I also used JQuery once. As a site builder, I create the pieces that the lead developer then uses to complete the website.</p>

<h3><strong>Do you enjoy your job? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong></h3>
<p>Yes. My colleagues are fun. I’m just a little unsatisfied with myself because I feel I could do better and learn faster.</p>
<h3><strong>How long did you spend looking for a job?</strong></h3>
<p>I left my previous job in June, started studying in July, and was working by the beginning of September. I got an offer through friends.</p>
<h3><strong>Did you use anything else than CodeBerry for your studies?</strong></h3>
<p>No, only CodeBerry.</p>

<h3><strong>Can you give advice to newbies as a former student?</strong></h3>
<p>I think it’s worth having an overview of the whole field before choosing a technology and diving deep into that. It’s enough to know the smallest sellable unit thoroughly instead of knowing a little bit of everything.</p>
<p>For instance, HTML5, CSS3, SCSS and Bootstrap are a great combo. You can easily become a junior developer with those.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>András P. Tóth</strong> studied computer science engineering at Budapest University of Technology and now works as a serial entrepreneur in the IT sector. He&#8217;s currently building <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">CodeBerry Programming School</a> with his friends. They hope to decrease the shortage of IT professionals in Hungary.</p>
<p>During the interview, Andris told us the story of his first [$110] salary and his first company sale as well as the cats of Instagram and the path lying in front of Hungarian developers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I live here</strong>: Budapest, Hungary.</p>
<p><strong>I work here</strong>: mostly at home, sometimes from internet cafés.</p>
<p><strong>I use</strong>: iPhone | MacBook Air | <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Sublime Text</a> | <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">bash</a> | PHP | <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Node.js</a> | <a href="https://mailchimp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Mailchimp</a> | Google</p>
<p><strong>My work style in a few words</strong>: small steps every day.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>When you&#8217;re asked about your profession, how do you answer?</h4>
<p>I usually say I build enterprises. If I see confusion, I add that I create enterprises in the IT sector. My job is to give other people jobs.</p>
<h4>Tell me more about what you do regarding programming?</h4>
<p>Normally I’m occupied by several different projects at once – some are for-profit (like CodeBerry Programming School), some are non-profit ones (e.g. Invisible University, <a href="http://yearcompass.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">YearCompass</a>). Sometimes, I just code to relax.</p>
<p>We started CodeBerry Programming School in 2016 with a few friends. We teach programming to people who’ve never done it before and help them find a job. Among other various tasks, I have plenty of things to do as a developer at this company:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m one of the code mentors who help students with technical things.</li>
<li>I write lots of code for our website as well as places where it connects to other software, like surveys, analytics and payment solutions.</li>
<li>I create modules for the system dealing with the programming homework, like admin statistics, badges, progression indicators.</li>
</ul>
<p>I relax by programming different little things I find interesting at that given moment. Some of my recent projects include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instagram script that gained followers for <a href="https://www.instagram.com/safranektheordinarycat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">our cat’s Instagram</a>.</li>
<li>Slack bot that creates photos of every teammate.</li>
<li>Temperature graph (with data collected by sensors).</li>
<li>Chrome plugin that shares the view of the webcam with another computer.</li>
</ul>

<h4></h4>
<h4>When, where and how did you learn to code?</h4>
<p>I was 10 years old when we got a C64 for Christmas. I learned programming with the help of books and friends. We had a little team captivated by the demoscene subculture, we all wanted to create art. We drew, composed music, programmed and, of course, competed with each other.</p>
<p>My first paid job was creating a webshop for an Italian company when I was sixteen. With the help of a dial-up internet connection, I would go online each night and attempt putting together a working website from code snippets I found on the internet. I was 18 when I applied to university where I studied computer science engineering.</p>
<p>In my third year, I started working as a developer and project manager. A year later I created my first company.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>What are the job opportunities for web developers? On average, how much time did you spend looking for a job?</h4>
<p>I have never looked for a job before. Until the middle of my university studies, people always approached me with developer jobs and, after that, I always worked for my own company. I still get emails via LinkedIn every other week, asking if I’m interested in developer jobs, so I think the market is pretty open to us.</p>
<h4>What is your daily, weekly, yearly schedule like?</h4>
<p>Usually, I get up between 6:30 and 7:30 in the morning, depending on meetings. I work out, take a shower, have breakfast, and work until midday. I have lunch with someone, then work again until five, and then I try and relax.</p>
<p>Mostly, I work from home, so sometimes I doze off in the afternoon, but that results in late-night work. That is not good for anyone.</p>
<p>Most of the times I apply the Pomodoro technique to my work—25 minutes of work followed by a 5-minute rest filled with some chores.</p>
<p>We have operative discussions on Monday and strategic discussions every Tuesday morning. Tuesday to Thursday we all work from our home offices, and Friday we organize live or online meetings to summarize the week.</p>
<p>My job is rather diverse—a part of it is communication (insider conversations, outsider meetings, and code mentoring), a part of it is marketing (managing ads, writing copy, and getting marketing systems to work), and some of it is technical (all kinds of programming tasks).</p>
<p>Four times a year, I take a week off. I also have a few day trips with my colleagues twice a year.<br />
The Invisible University causes two weeks every six months to be rather packed (at the beginning and the end of each semester), and the YearCompass results in an intensive December and January. These make me accept fewer other jobs in these periods.</p>
<h4>What surprised you about this job that you never thought of before?</h4>
<p>Time flies when you program. I start solving a problem and two blinks later it’s already night time. This really surprised me first.</p>
<p>The other thing is the speed with which the whole programming knowledge evolves. I occupied myself with marketing for a few years and when I returned to programming, I could hardly understand what my colleagues were talking about.</p>
<p>It must have been a similar feeling to what elderly people experience when their children try to explain things they can’t catch up with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12028 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Do you have skills that would surprise everyday people?</h4>
<p>When somebody asks for help from us (e.g. “the internet is down” or “the printer doesn’t work”), we usually don’t know the solution right away either. All we do is patiently read the error message and find the answer on the internet.</p>
<h4>Who do you work with?</h4>
<p>I work alone a lot. We have weekly meetings, and chat each day with colleagues, if we work on tasks together. I also exchange emails with suppliers, partners, consultants, and the press frequently.</p>
<h4>What are the typical career paths in your profession?</h4>
<p>I think there are a few pronounced paths for IT professionals:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can choose the size and style of the company: freelancer, startup, small business, medium business, multinational and governmental companies.</li>
<li>You can choose a topic: operating, developing, planning, testing or even management, sales, support, growth, data, etc.</li>
<li>You’re distinct by your experience: entry-level, junior, senior, etc.<br />
and within each path, there are many specific junctions (e.g. a developer could be an Angular specialist front-end web developer)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can choose to navigate through these routes all through your life.</p>
<p>I see many examples among my friends too:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s popular to go from zero to infinite on the programming path.</li>
<li>There are plenty of “I started as an IT specialist but found out I was good with people, so I became manager” situations.</li>
<li>There are a few “I started at multinational companies, but I’m trying to build my own business”.</li>
<li>And few of my friends start off with running their own company in the first place.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What are your plans, how do you wish to continue?</h4>
<p>I’m over my first company sale (“Gyümölcstárhely”, a web hosting service was my first company, that was bought by one of Europe’s biggest hosting companies) and many failed projects too. So far, I really enjoyed this entrepreneur-developer combination, so it’s probably what I’m going to continue.</p>
<h4>What other profession would you choose if you had to change? Could you change?</h4>
<p>I wouldn’t change. I really enjoy teaching, so I can imagine doing some kind of consultant-trainer thing. I could probably change to a normal IT job and possibly marketing due to my entrepreneurship experience.</p>
<h4>What skills do great developers, IT experts require? Who do you not recommend this profession to?</h4>
<p>I find the following skills important:</p>
<ul>
<li>Engagement in details – it’s pretty difficult to code in a superficial style. You have to pay attention to the details.</li>
<li>The capability of concentration – finding a single error sometimes takes hours.</li>
<li>Proper English skills – if I’m stuck, I can only find help on the internet in English.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t recommend this profession if you don’t have these skills.</p>
<h4>What’s your favourite part?</h4>
<p>I love programs you can leave running for hours, days or weeks, doing something useful. Creating something that works is also a great feeling.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12255 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h4>What grinds your gears most? What are the difficulties and dangers of your profession?</h4>
<p>The &#8220;professional religious wars&#8221; are both annoying and entertaining. Seeing people fight over text editors and whether you should format code with tabs or spaces&#8230;</p>
<p>It’s not easy to keep up with the constantly changing technology—deciding on which program language to use or which new tool is good enough to be learned.</p>
<p>Plus, there are dangers in this profession:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sitting all day – you need some extra effort if you don’t want to end up being a fat geek.</li>
<li>The bubble – it’s easy to think a company packed with IT professionals are all well-paid 20-50-year old men who understand programming jokes.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How stable is your job? How much time does one spend working for the same company?</h4>
<p>I work in a startup. There are faster-changing projects, undeveloped processes, and bigger uncertainty compared to a bigger, well-functioning company. I worked for 5-6 years in my previous companies; we always started new ones after that.</p>
<p>I have never heard of an IT professional being fired among my friends. Some are more loyal and work decades at the same company, while others change every few years, motivated by higher wages and more interesting roles.</p>
<h4>If you had to ask for one thing in the name of all developers, what would it be?</h4>
<p>As an IT specialist, I would ask, please read the error messages and Google them before you call us.</p>
<p>As an entrepreneur, I wish for clear and understandable emails when seeking help after something goes wrong—what have they tried, what did they expect and what happened instead—and we’ll think of the solution together.</p>
<h4>How much can one earn in this profession (as a newbie, experienced and veteran)?</h4>
<p>In my experience as an entrepreneur:</p>
<ul>
<li>I didn’t make a penny during the first year. I only fed the project with my money.</li>
<li>The first month after the tipping point I could pay myself $110. Later my salary slowly grew to $15,000.</li>
<li>I gained a bigger amount by selling my company. Enough to cover all expenses in the next 4-5 years, letting me focus on my next project.</li>
</ul>
<p>My developer friends usually make more than that. Most of the time, they have a secrecy agreement, so we can only speak of approximates: they make $15,000-30,000 in Hungary, more as a leader, and well over $70,000 in the West. It’s worth browsing <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Glassdoor</a>; they have a lot of info about salaries.</p>
<h4>What do you think is the best way to learn to code?</h4>
<p>There are a lot of great online and offline courses. We collected these on a website: http://programozastanfolyam.com./</p>
<p>The following things helped me the most:</p>
<ul>
<li>Actually having to type the solution to a given task (instead of reading it in a book or watching a video about it)</li>
<li>Specific projects that I could finish (e.g. I’ll build a site for a friend or a project)</li>
<li>A friend or mentor who already knew how to code and could help me when I had problems.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What makes code worth learning?</h4>
<p>For me, programming:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lets me experience creating something.</li>
<li>Offers job opportunities and stable financial support.</li>
<li>Is relaxing.</li>
</ul>
