We had a chat with Attila about how he got here, what he learned about programming, and the difficulties of finding a job as a junior developer. </span></p>
<h3><strong>When someone asked about your profession a few months ago, how did you answer? </strong></h3>
<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;I used to say my job is networking at IT Services, meaning that I helped big companies join the internet. Our task spread from assuring the router arrived at the customer to actually making it work.&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:384,&quot;10&quot;:1,&quot;11&quot;:3}">I used to say my job is networking at <a href="https://www.it-services.hu/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">IT Services,</a> meaning that I helped big companies join the internet. Our task spread from assuring the router arrived at the customer to actually making it work. </span></p>
<h3><strong>And what is your answer now?</strong></h3>
<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;I’m a frontend UI developer at EPAM. I work in a bigger team, developing an application relying mainly on frontend technologies and designing the user interface. I use HTML, CSS and JavaScript on a daily basis.&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:384,&quot;10&quot;:1,&quot;11&quot;:3}">I’m a frontend UI developer at <a href="https://www.epam.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">EPAM</a>.

<h3><strong>That sounds great! So, programming wasn’t really a new task for you, was it? Did you encounter coding earlier?</strong></h3>
<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;I’m a frontend UI developer at EPAM. I work in a bigger team, developing an application relying mainly on frontend technologies and designing the user interface. I use HTML, CSS and JavaScript on a daily basis.&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:384,&quot;10&quot;:1,&quot;11&quot;:3}">Yes, I actually started using HTML and CSS during elementary school. Later in high school, we used Python all the time, relying on an antique book. I had to quit doing it because the libraries cited by the author didn’t exist anymore, so the tasks were unsolvable. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></p>
<h3><strong>Where did the idea of web development come from? </strong></h3>
<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;I’m a frontend UI developer at EPAM. I work in a bigger team, developing an application relying mainly on frontend technologies and designing the user interface. I use HTML, CSS and JavaScript on a daily basis.&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:384,&quot;10&quot;:1,&quot;11&quot;:3}">During my senior year of high school, two guys approached me, saying they needed web developers for their startup. Back then I had no clue about what I was about to dive into, but I said yes and I soon got the hang of it. Eventually, we finished the project, but web development had caught my attention, so I continued learning it on my own. Finally, I ran into a dead-end in spring, when I felt I can’t go on alone, I need a teacher. That’s when I found you. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </span></p>

<h3><strong>How long have you been studying with CodeBerry? </strong></h3>
<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;I’m a frontend UI developer at EPAM. I work in a bigger team, developing an application relying mainly on frontend technologies and designing the user interface. I use HTML, CSS and JavaScript on a daily basis.&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:384,&quot;10&quot;:1,&quot;11&quot;:3}">Since June 2016. </span></p>
<h3><strong>And how did you like it, what were the advantages? </strong></h3>
<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;I’m a frontend UI developer at EPAM. I work in a bigger team, developing an application relying mainly on frontend technologies and designing the user interface. I use HTML, CSS and JavaScript on a daily basis.&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:384,&quot;10&quot;:1,&quot;11&quot;:3}">To be honest, there wasn&#8217;t a tremendous amount of new information, but the course was great for recollecting my knowledge. The mentors helped me a lot – that was probably one of the best things in it. Having someone to discuss your problems with is a huge advantage. </span></p>

<p>That’s good to hear. Now it’s the beginning of autumn, that means you’ve gained enough knowledge in 3 months to find a job.</p>

I use HTML, CSS and JavaScript on a daily basis.&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:384,&quot;10&quot;:1,&quot;11&quot;:3}">I created a LinkedIn profile, where I stated I was studying to become a junior developer and added my new skills too. Two weeks later EPAM contacted me. I was going to create a portfolio before contemplating looking for a job, but EPAM was faster. They invited me to an interview right away. </span></p>
<h3><strong>I wanted to ask you if the search was difficult, but I guess we can skip this question. </strong></h3>
<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;I’m a frontend UI developer at EPAM. I work in a bigger team, developing an application relying mainly on frontend technologies and designing the user interface.

<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12255 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>What is the next step for you? What direction are you taking? </strong></h3>
<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;I’m a frontend UI developer at EPAM. I work in a bigger team, developing an application relying mainly on frontend technologies and designing the user interface. I use HTML, CSS and JavaScript on a daily basis.&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:384,&quot;10&quot;:1,&quot;11&quot;:3}">React environment is my current favourite, I would like to learn more about it in the upcoming period. It’s also a huge dream of mine to teach programming in some form. Giving lectures or taking part in some more specific program, I don’t know yet, nor do I know how it’s going to happen, but I’m sure it will happen somehow. </span></p>
<h3><strong>As a well-experienced student, do you have any tips for those just starting to code? </strong></h3>
<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;I’m a frontend UI developer at EPAM. I work in a bigger team, developing an application relying mainly on frontend technologies and designing the user interface. I use HTML, CSS and JavaScript on a daily basis.&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:384,&quot;10&quot;:1,&quot;11&quot;:3}">I think it’s important to understand that the learning process can’t really be accelerated. Programming is a big challenge, not easy in the beginning. But once you’ve got the hang of it and understand the logic, it all becomes clear. From that point onwards everything speeds up. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </span></p>
