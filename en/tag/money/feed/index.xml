</ul>
<h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, programming skills are in high demand. According to the CNBC article, “<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/22/glassdoor-the-20-best-jobs-in-america-in-2019.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">The 20 Best Jobs in America in 2019</a>”, Software Engineering is the 10th best job with a median base pay of $104,000 per year. In addition, this list includes a number of other jobs in which programming skills would be extremely beneficial, if not a specific requirement. The top job specified is Data Engineer. It’s perfectly reasonable to expect that programming skills would go a long way in helping you land a role in this field. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we’re going to go over some of the many reasons why you should </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">learn programming</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and how it could change your life. This could be through obtaining a new career or simply building some cool stuff to show off to your friends. We’re going to talk about money and the ways in which coding skills can be applied in various different areas. We’re also going to talk about how gaining these competencies can actually help you develop as a person in an increasingly digital world.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12017 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3><b>Money</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s an unavoidable fact: salaries are super important. Most people want to know that any time investment they make into learning new skills will pay off in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned above, some of the most sought-after skills in today’s world are programming related. From simple scripting to building software that will push the boundaries of science as we know it &#8211; see Katie Bouman’s amazing black-hole imaging program &#8211; technology is becoming increasingly intrinsic to the very fabric of society. And code is what drives it all. So, it may not come as a surprise that companies will pay a ton of money to get great developers into their teams.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some stats about software salaries to get you excited about your future prospects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to payscale.com, entry-level software engineers get paid these salaries in the following US cities:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York, New York &#8211; $96,200 per year.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco, California &#8211; $112,368 per year.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Austin, Texas &#8211; $79,154 per year.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Remember:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It’s important to do your own research before making any decisions.</span></p>
<h3><b>Control Your Own Destiny</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contrary to popular belief, you don’t need a degree in Computer Science to be a programmer.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> There are very few requirements for getting started; just a computer and an internet connection. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With these two things, you can start learning and taking online courses in no time.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Additionally, there are many free programming resources that come with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">practice problems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This opens up a number of possibilities for the budding programmer. While salaried </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">software development</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> jobs are sometimes better in terms of money, job security and benefits, there are many other avenues available with their own unique appeal. I’ll talk about some of these below.</span></p>
<h4><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freelancing</span></i></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’d like to work for yourself, choose your own clients and even decide when to get out of bed, this might be for you. There are various services on the web which help with this lifestyle, such as Upwork, Codementor, and Freelancer. If you don’t want to use one of these sites, you could court your own clients and build relationships and connections within the industry. A lot of big tech companies started this way &#8211; with just a couple of people working for themselves to build their dream.</span></p>
<h4><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start your own online business</span></i></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have no interest in becoming a software engineer by trade? So what! You can still leverage your programming skills to build your own business, whether that be in e-commerce, private consultancy, construction or… anything really!</span></p>
<h3><b>Develop New Skills</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning to code is more than just </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">learning to code. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s actually learning to think analytically, break down problems, design solutions and loads of other things. For example, if you’re working with others on a project, you’ll learn collaborative skills. If you’re building a complex piece of software or a computer program that you want to ship to others, you’ll learn communication skills, because you need to make sure you document it as well as possible. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12028 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning to code isn’t just about putting words on a screen in a specific order; it’s about transforming the way you think about things. And those kinds of competencies are valuable in any area of modern life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t learn popular programming languages because everyone else is doing it. Choose what you want to learn! </span></p>
<h3><b>Limitless Possibilities</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning to code opens up a world of exciting possibilities, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">whether you decide to learn web development, game development, or Android development</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve learned the basics, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">you can build video games, websites, desktop applications, and mobile apps. You can create scrapers that trawl through web content and gather data. You can build visualization software, which can take large amounts of inaccessible information and present it in a clear manner. Want to build an evil Artificial Intelligence </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">equipped with machine learning</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, enslave humanity and eventually take over the known universe? Why not? You can do that too (maybe).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another fun and creative thing that’s possible with coding skills is generative art. This is the art that is created by drawing pixels onto the screen based on </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">some kind of algorithm.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I came across a website not too long ago that takes three values—day, month &amp; year—and uses them in a mathematical equation to generate an image. You can see an example of this </span><a href="https://www.johndcook.com/expsum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Cool, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also contribute to open-source projects. This is software that’s built under a special license and available for free use in any other software. It’s often a team effort, and a great way to make friends and be a part of something much bigger than just yourself. There are loads of projects out there right now waiting for your input.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are some great examples of things you can do with code, but truthfully, they barely even scratch the surface. The only way you can begin to explore the countless possibilities is to put your hands to the keyboard and get started.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12019 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3><b>Conclusion</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve looked at a few reasons why you should learn programming. We’ve talked about the salary prospects, the ability to control your own destiny, its benefits in helping to develop other skills and all the cool and creative possibilities it brings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, it’s becoming more essential to our very lives each and every day. We live in a digital world, and this is only going to become truer as time progresses. If you start developing these skills now, you can try to ride the wave rather than be helplessly carried along with it. The resources are out there and you can start today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what are you waiting for?</span></p>

<h2>How Much Do Programmers Make?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our previous article, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“<a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/a-brief-introduction-to-programming/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Introduction to Programming</a>,”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we briefly discussed some of the incredible benefits of working as a coder, such as the ability to work from home, a more flexible schedule, higher pay, and access to more job opportunities—both locally and globally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, for most, the greatest motive for learning to program is the salary and the earning potential associated with this lucrative career. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we stated before in our previous article, money should not be your only source of motivation when choosing a job in programming. It’s important to maintain a realistic mindset and remember that being a developer is not unlike any other career. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There will be moments of joy and frustration, boredom and excitement, laziness and motivation, stress and relaxation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For this reason, it’s absolutely necessary that you develop a passion for programming and learn perseverance so that you will stick with it—even when things get rough. In addition to these two qualities, many factors will determine your continued success in this career.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, money is a compelling reason to work, so let’s take a look at what you can expect to earn as a programmer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To provide you with a general overview of computer programmer salaries, we’ll be using information from</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> global averages. While the national average salary in your country might be rather low, this information should still give you a good idea of what you can make by accessing the global market online.</span></p>
<h2>Average IT Salary</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below are the results from the 2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survey. In the survey, nearly 90.000 respondents answered a questionnaire regarding their job, salary, experience, and skillset.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see, salaries for programmers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are substantially high</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the global average. However, with an increasingly virtual workplace, you’ll likely be able to have access to some of these jobs by working remotely. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on your skillset and your position, your salary in the global market can vary between an average of $40,000 and $89,000 per year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like we’ve mentioned in earlier articles, many of the world’s largest tech companies are based in the USA, especially in expensive areas such as San Francisco. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For this reason, we see that salaries for entry-level programming positions in the United States raise the global average. However, don’t get the idea that you won’t make much money because you aren’t in the United States.</span></p>
<p><div style="width: 970px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://pixabay.com/hu/photos/munka-hivatal-csapat-v%C3%A1llalat-5382501/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large" src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2020/07/08/04/12/work-5382501_960_720.jpg" alt="There are plenty of statisics about how much can you make as a programmer" width="960" height="578" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">There are plenty of statisics about how much can you make as a programmer</p></div></p>
<p><strong>Starting Salary</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you first start learning to code, you’ll probably start with languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which help you become a front-end developer or designer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are entry-level positions that will give you the expertise and skills you need to continue in your career. The global average salary for a front-end developer is $51,000 and the average for a designer is $46,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re not aware of the difference between front-end and back-end development, check out our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/a-brief-introduction-to-web-development/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Introduction to Web Development</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have mastered the basics of front-end development, you should consider looking at jobs in back-end development. Working in this position will earn you an average salary of $56,000 globally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a relatively small raise, but it provides you with the opportunity to continue rising through the ranks and getting the highest paid jobs. </span></p>
<p><b>Highest Paying Jobs </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The growing demand for artificial intelligence and our ever-increasing reliance on technology continues to create plenty of high-paying opportunities for programmers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DevOps and machine learning are growing trends in the software industry today. Associated languages and frameworks are on the rise and software developers working in these areas command the highest salaries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll also want to learn the fundamentals of programming and become an expert in common languages, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, Python, and a few more. Knowledge of these languages will make you more versatile and capable as a programmer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to learning the most common programming languages and technologies, it’s important that you focus on a specific set of skills, like web development, systems programming or devops. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As in most careers, specialising will increase your abilities and your prospects. But don’t shy away from learning other things, too. You can never be too knowledgeable!</span></p>

<h2>Why Computer Programmers Make So Much Money</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, we rely on technology for just about everything, including communication, entertainment, transportation, finances, and even dating. In fact, it’s hard to imagine our world without it.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the not-too-distant future, knowing how to code will likely become a requirement for all professions that is just as important as the ability to read and write. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, learning to program will not only open up new job opportunities in the future, but will also help you grow in your current career. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like the price of goods, both supply and demand determine the cost of workers in the job market. Currently, we are experiencing both a global shortage of coders and increasing demand from tech startups and established companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to high demand and low supply, programmers are bringing home great salaries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As technology continues to advance and becomes more prominent in our daily lives, salaries related to computer programming are bound to continue in an upward direction in the foreseeable future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter what hobbies or interests you may have, you can be sure that it involves technology. For example, you could combine your love for music with programming and become a sound engineer or use your coding skills and creative talents to create beautiful digital artwork. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you don’t consider yourself a creative or artistic person, learning to program will still help you in your career and personal development. </span></p>
<h2>Learning to Program Is a Good Investment</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Programming is one of the few professions that allows you to earn a six-figure salary, regardless of your level of education. Careers with similar salaries, such as engineering, medicine, and law, require you to spend incredible amounts of time and money to achieve the same results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Programming, on the other hand, allows you to reach the same level of financial success in just a fraction of the time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As long as you have the skills and the knowledge to get your job done, you won’t need to go into debt and attend a university for 4 years. Instead, you’ll be able to teach yourself online and learn through a variety of methods which we’ll discuss in our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”<a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/how-to-learn-to-code/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">How to Learn How to Code</a>”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> article. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is great news for those of us who didn’t have the opportunity to pursue higher education. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe that learning to code makes a positive impact on the world and allows the disadvantaged to make a modest living. In many countries where the minimum wage is below the poverty line, remote programming jobs give people opportunities that wouldn’t otherwise exist in their country.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To learn how CodeBerry is working to solve the global shortage of coders and is making a positive impact, check out our ‘<a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/press/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">press page</a>’. </span></p>
<h2>Will Learning to Code Get Me a Job?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning in-demand skills and sought-after programming languages will directly affect your earnings and your desirability as an employee. It will also prevent you from being replaced by new recruits that have a better understanding of current trends and technologies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To those of you who may be concerned about your age: have no fear. While many programmers and coders tend to be younger, professionals in their 40’s and 50’s should not be worried about beginning a new career in programming. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, entering the job market with up-to-date knowledge and recently learned skills can put you on the same level as new graduates and other young people in the job market. The key to getting a new job in programming at an older age is to stay humble, keep an open mind, and be willing to change.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many employers report that they prefer to hire younger prospects because of their willingness to change and adaptability—not their skills or experience. If you’re unwilling to eliminate old behaviors and replace old knowledge with new information, you might want to reconsider pursuing a career in technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, no set of skills or degree can completely guarantee you a job. It’s up to you to continuously learn, improve your skills, and search for new ways to future-proof yourself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if you’re going to learn any skill in 2019, learning to program is definitely one of your best options when it comes to finding a job and boosting your earning potential. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once a rather male-dominated field, programming has made large strides to be more inclusive. The number of female programmers has grown dramatically in recent years, with women showing more interest than ever in learning to code. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here at CodeBerry, at least 40% of our students are female—a percentage that we’d like to grow even larger.  </span></p>
<h2>How Much Will YOU Make?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How much you will make as a programmer can depend on a number of factors: your skill level, years of experience, and location.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to the internet and the ever-increasing popularity of remote work, your location is less of a factor than ever. Even if the average salary in your country may be rather low, working remotely gives you access to a global marketplace that values your skills and abilities over your geographical location. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll also want to learn how to market yourself well, whether you’re working as a freelancer or for a traditional company. Marketing yourself and creating a personal brand is especially important if you’re a freelancer and you are constantly dealing with short-term contracts and multiple clients to find work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regarding the specific skills needed to increase your earning potential, you can learn all about that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;<a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/which-programming-language-is-right-for-you/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Which programming language is good for you?</a>&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> article.  </span></p>
<h2>Additional Benefits of Learning How to Code</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, it’s pretty clear that learning how to write code will help you have high salaries. Are there any other benefits to learning this valuable skill? As it turns out, there are. Learning programming can help you in your personal development—not just in your career. </span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critical Thinking</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning to program will teach you about mathematics, logic, and critical thinking as you progress. Programming introduces you to topics such as boolean logic, variables, “if” statements, and other concepts that will improve your ability to think and construct logical arguments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, we know that you might be thinking, “I’ve never been good at math in my entire life.” That’s perfectly okay; most developers aren’t that great at math either. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more you learn and practice programming, the easier it will be to understand the overarching concepts. Don’t beat yourself up if you aren’t able to get it all on the first try; you’re still on time to catch up. </span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personal Projects</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most fun part about learning to code is the ability to create your own websites, games, programs, and mobile applications. Perhaps, you’ve always dreamed of having your own custom website for your portfolio, an app to keep you organized throughout the day, or your ideal videogame. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of these dreams can become a reality with programming. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe, you’ve considered creating a digital product or online service to start your own business and become an independent entrepreneur? In that case, you’ll definitely want to learn how to code to save yourself some money (now that you know how much programmers make). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being able to code will also give you complete freedom to create what you want. The only limit is your imagination and your time. </span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Future-proof Yourself </span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world is changing quickly and you definitely don’t want to be left behind. Even basic knowledge and understanding of code will help you to future-proof yourself and ensure that you don’t become obsolete in a technological landscape. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not just about getting a job either; learning to program will help you keep up with the modern world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business reports and projections continue to show that programming will only become more relevant in the coming years. That’s why it’s best to start learning as soon as you can. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://pixabay.com/hu/photos/az-emberek-h%C3%A1rom-ember-iroda-%C3%BCzleti-2270641/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large" src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/04/29/12/31/people-2270641_960_720.jpg" alt="You can already make a good salary as a beginner" width="960" height="661" /></a></p>
