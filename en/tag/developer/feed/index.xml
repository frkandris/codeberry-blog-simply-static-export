<h2>How Much Do Programmers Make?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our previous article, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“<a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/a-brief-introduction-to-programming/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Introduction to Programming</a>,”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we briefly discussed some of the incredible benefits of working as a coder, such as the ability to work from home, a more flexible schedule, higher pay, and access to more job opportunities—both locally and globally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, for most, the greatest motive for learning to program is the salary and the earning potential associated with this lucrative career. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we stated before in our previous article, money should not be your only source of motivation when choosing a job in programming. It’s important to maintain a realistic mindset and remember that being a developer is not unlike any other career. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There will be moments of joy and frustration, boredom and excitement, laziness and motivation, stress and relaxation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For this reason, it’s absolutely necessary that you develop a passion for programming and learn perseverance so that you will stick with it—even when things get rough. In addition to these two qualities, many factors will determine your continued success in this career.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, money is a compelling reason to work, so let’s take a look at what you can expect to earn as a programmer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To provide you with a general overview of computer programmer salaries, we’ll be using information from</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> global averages. While the national average salary in your country might be rather low, this information should still give you a good idea of what you can make by accessing the global market online.</span></p>
<h2>Average IT Salary</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below are the results from the 2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survey. In the survey, nearly 90.000 respondents answered a questionnaire regarding their job, salary, experience, and skillset. In the following graph, we are able to see the average IT salary by position: </span></p>

</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Source: <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survey</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see, salaries for programmers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are substantially high</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the global average. However, with an increasingly virtual workplace, you’ll likely be able to have access to some of these jobs by working remotely. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on your skillset and your position, your salary in the global market can vary between an average of $40,000 and $89,000 per year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like we’ve mentioned in earlier articles, many of the world’s largest tech companies are based in the USA, especially in expensive areas such as San Francisco. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For this reason, we see that salaries for entry-level programming positions in the United States raise the global average. However, don’t get the idea that you won’t make much money because you aren’t in the United States.</span></p>
<p><div style="width: 970px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://pixabay.com/hu/photos/munka-hivatal-csapat-v%C3%A1llalat-5382501/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large" src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2020/07/08/04/12/work-5382501_960_720.jpg" alt="There are plenty of statisics about how much can you make as a programmer" width="960" height="578" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">There are plenty of statisics about how much can you make as a programmer</p></div></p>
<p><strong>Starting Salary</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you first start learning to code, you’ll probably start with languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which help you become a front-end developer or designer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are entry-level positions that will give you the expertise and skills you need to continue in your career. The global average salary for a front-end developer is $51,000 and the average for a designer is $46,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re not aware of the difference between front-end and back-end development, check out our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/a-brief-introduction-to-web-development/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Introduction to Web Development</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have mastered the basics of front-end development, you should consider looking at jobs in back-end development. Working in this position will earn you an average salary of $56,000 globally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a relatively small raise, but it provides you with the opportunity to continue rising through the ranks and getting the highest paid jobs. </span></p>
<p><b>Highest Paying Jobs </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The growing demand for artificial intelligence and our ever-increasing reliance on technology continues to create plenty of high-paying opportunities for programmers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DevOps and machine learning are growing trends in the software industry today. Associated languages and frameworks are on the rise and software developers working in these areas command the highest salaries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll also want to learn the fundamentals of programming and become an expert in common languages, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, Python, and a few more. Knowledge of these languages will make you more versatile and capable as a programmer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to learning the most common programming languages and technologies, it’s important that you focus on a specific set of skills, like web development, systems programming or devops. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As in most careers, specialising will increase your abilities and your prospects. But don’t shy away from learning other things, too. You can never be too knowledgeable!</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12018 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h2>Why Computer Programmers Make So Much Money</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, we rely on technology for just about everything, including communication, entertainment, transportation, finances, and even dating. In fact, it’s hard to imagine our world without it.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the not-too-distant future, knowing how to code will likely become a requirement for all professions that is just as important as the ability to read and write. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, learning to program will not only open up new job opportunities in the future, but will also help you grow in your current career. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like the price of goods, both supply and demand determine the cost of workers in the job market. Currently, we are experiencing both a global shortage of coders and increasing demand from tech startups and established companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to high demand and low supply, programmers are bringing home great salaries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As technology continues to advance and becomes more prominent in our daily lives, salaries related to computer programming are bound to continue in an upward direction in the foreseeable future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter what hobbies or interests you may have, you can be sure that it involves technology. For example, you could combine your love for music with programming and become a sound engineer or use your coding skills and creative talents to create beautiful digital artwork. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you don’t consider yourself a creative or artistic person, learning to program will still help you in your career and personal development. </span></p>
<h2>Learning to Program Is a Good Investment</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Programming is one of the few professions that allows you to earn a six-figure salary, regardless of your level of education. Careers with similar salaries, such as engineering, medicine, and law, require you to spend incredible amounts of time and money to achieve the same results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Programming, on the other hand, allows you to reach the same level of financial success in just a fraction of the time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As long as you have the skills and the knowledge to get your job done, you won’t need to go into debt and attend a university for 4 years. Instead, you’ll be able to teach yourself online and learn through a variety of methods which we’ll discuss in our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”<a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/how-to-learn-to-code/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">How to Learn How to Code</a>”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> article. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is great news for those of us who didn’t have the opportunity to pursue higher education. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe that learning to code makes a positive impact on the world and allows the disadvantaged to make a modest living. In many countries where the minimum wage is below the poverty line, remote programming jobs give people opportunities that wouldn’t otherwise exist in their country.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To learn how CodeBerry is working to solve the global shortage of coders and is making a positive impact, check out our ‘<a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/press/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">press page</a>’. </span></p>
<h2>Will Learning to Code Get Me a Job?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning in-demand skills and sought-after programming languages will directly affect your earnings and your desirability as an employee. It will also prevent you from being replaced by new recruits that have a better understanding of current trends and technologies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To those of you who may be concerned about your age: have no fear. While many programmers and coders tend to be younger, professionals in their 40’s and 50’s should not be worried about beginning a new career in programming. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, entering the job market with up-to-date knowledge and recently learned skills can put you on the same level as new graduates and other young people in the job market. The key to getting a new job in programming at an older age is to stay humble, keep an open mind, and be willing to change.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many employers report that they prefer to hire younger prospects because of their willingness to change and adaptability—not their skills or experience. If you’re unwilling to eliminate old behaviors and replace old knowledge with new information, you might want to reconsider pursuing a career in technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, no set of skills or degree can completely guarantee you a job. It’s up to you to continuously learn, improve your skills, and search for new ways to future-proof yourself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if you’re going to learn any skill in 2019, learning to program is definitely one of your best options when it comes to finding a job and boosting your earning potential. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once a rather male-dominated field, programming has made large strides to be more inclusive. The number of female programmers has grown dramatically in recent years, with women showing more interest than ever in learning to code. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here at CodeBerry, at least 40% of our students are female—a percentage that we’d like to grow even larger.  </span></p>
<h2>How Much Will YOU Make?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How much you will make as a programmer can depend on a number of factors: your skill level, years of experience, and location.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to the internet and the ever-increasing popularity of remote work, your location is less of a factor than ever. Even if the average salary in your country may be rather low, working remotely gives you access to a global marketplace that values your skills and abilities over your geographical location. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll also want to learn how to market yourself well, whether you’re working as a freelancer or for a traditional company. Marketing yourself and creating a personal brand is especially important if you’re a freelancer and you are constantly dealing with short-term contracts and multiple clients to find work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regarding the specific skills needed to increase your earning potential, you can learn all about that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;<a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/which-programming-language-is-right-for-you/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Which programming language is good for you?</a>&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> article.  </span></p>
<h2>Additional Benefits of Learning How to Code</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, it’s pretty clear that learning how to write code will help you have high salaries. Are there any other benefits to learning this valuable skill? As it turns out, there are. Learning programming can help you in your personal development—not just in your career. </span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critical Thinking</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning to program will teach you about mathematics, logic, and critical thinking as you progress. Programming introduces you to topics such as boolean logic, variables, “if” statements, and other concepts that will improve your ability to think and construct logical arguments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, we know that you might be thinking, “I’ve never been good at math in my entire life.” That’s perfectly okay; most developers aren’t that great at math either. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more you learn and practice programming, the easier it will be to understand the overarching concepts. Don’t beat yourself up if you aren’t able to get it all on the first try; you’re still on time to catch up. </span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personal Projects</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most fun part about learning to code is the ability to create your own websites, games, programs, and mobile applications. Perhaps, you’ve always dreamed of having your own custom website for your portfolio, an app to keep you organized throughout the day, or your ideal videogame. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of these dreams can become a reality with programming. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe, you’ve considered creating a digital product or online service to start your own business and become an independent entrepreneur? In that case, you’ll definitely want to learn how to code to save yourself some money (now that you know how much programmers make). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being able to code will also give you complete freedom to create what you want. The only limit is your imagination and your time. </span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Future-proof Yourself </span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world is changing quickly and you definitely don’t want to be left behind. Even basic knowledge and understanding of code will help you to future-proof yourself and ensure that you don’t become obsolete in a technological landscape. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not just about getting a job either; learning to program will help you keep up with the modern world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business reports and projections continue to show that programming will only become more relevant in the coming years. That’s why it’s best to start learning as soon as you can. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Landing those first few developer roles in your career can be hard.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you convince someone to hire you when you have limited experience? What things are critical to know? What if you get asked a question you don’t know the answer to?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> need to know </span><a href="https://twitter.com/ppk/status/963850873003757569" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">how to write a &lt;link&gt; tag from scratch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Spoiler: you don’t).</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve been working as a web developer for about a decade. I’ve held various roles in companies of all shapes and sizes — from global tech companies to small local agencies. I’ve been interviewed more times than I can count, and I’ve had more rejections than successes. As I have progressed to more senior positions, I increasingly find myself on the other side of the table.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m going to share some things that I look for when I’m interviewing new candidates. Perhaps more importantly, they are things that have helped me feel more confident when I’m the one being interviewed.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The technical requirements of any given role will vary, so I won’t be giving you any suggestions about addressing those. There are plenty of articles with titles like </span><b>“10 Things Every Modern Web Developer Must Know”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You can use those to guide (or more likely, overwhelm) you.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What I am going to suggest, overall, is that you shouldn’t fret about the things you </span><b>don’t know</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>1. Be comfortable with your experience and abilities</b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking about your experience is usually the starting point for an interview. It’s also usually the first thing on your CV. Showing your experience and how you’ve applied your skills and abilities is a fundamental part of any interview process.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s normal to feel the pressure of making a good first impression. As such, it can be tempting to oversell yourself and your abilities, or to exaggerate the importance of a project you have worked on.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But you must remember — you’re not expected to have a wealth of experience or technical ability when starting out. Exaggerating or overselling your experience will create a less than ideal first impression, even if you’re otherwise well-suited for the role. This is something that is true at any point in your career, but it’s an easy trap to fall into when you’re starting out.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s much better to simply be factual about your experience and ability. Talk about the projects you’ve worked on and your specific role within those projects. Highlight the skills you used and technology you’ve been exposed to while working on them.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show, don’t tell.</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a principle in story-telling that I think also applies to job interviews.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t </span><b>tell</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> your audience what is happening, </span><b>show</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> them with actions and allow them to interpret it and arrive at a conclusion themselves.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if the interviewer can arrive at this conclusion by themselves:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This candidate is experienced with Y, and is clearly passionate about X”.</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is much more valuable than you telling them:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m highly experienced with Y, and very passionate about X”.</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equally as important as not overselling your skills and experience is being able to admit you don’t know something.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12028 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><b>2. Don’t be afraid to say “I don’t know”</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s easy to feel pressured to answer a question you don’t know the answer to. If you do, this is what is likely to happen:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll copy/paste together snippets of information you’ve heard or read and regurgitate whatever comes to mind first. You’ll hope to hit on the right combination of words to answer the question. You’ll stumble, sound incoherent, and get flustered.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let me be as unambiguous about this as possible. Saying “I don’t know” when you don’t know the answer to something is </span><b>always</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the best answer. Don’t pretend to know something you don’t.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re made to feel uncomfortable for saying “I don’t know” in an interview, you should treat that as a red flag. It’s usually a sign of a toxic workplace. You don’t want to work at a company that doesn’t encourage vulnerability.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t know something, always be upfront and admit it. You can always follow up with what you think</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the answer might be. Even better, you can follow up with a question.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t know much about X, but I think it’s related to Y. Can you give me some more detail? Are you using X in your projects?</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often, the answer to your follow up questions will allow you to give a secondary response. Even though you didn’t know the answer, you can show that you understand the context.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12255 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>3. Ask questions. Lots of them.</b><b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asking follow up questions is also a great way to make an interview feel less formal and more like a discussion.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interviewers are often more than happy to talk about their experience with a particular technology, or the challenges they’ve faced on a particular project. This can also help give you insight into why they consider a certain skill or technology to be important for the role.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also remember that an interview is also about you evaluating your potential employer. You can’t properly evaluate them without asking questions.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What project will I be working on? What are some projects this company has recently completed? How large is the team I will be working in? What resources will be available to me for training and personal development?</span></i><br />
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This isn’t only something that is valuable for the interview. Making an objective evaluation of your options is a daily task for a developer. To do that, you need to gather the right information — and to do that, you need to ask questions. Lots of them.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>The candidate with the best technical skills isn’t always the one that gets hired.</b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">My intention here isn’t to sound authoritative about what you should or shouldn’t do in an interview. Nor is it to proclaim that technical skills don’t matter.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, what I am trying to make clear is that learning isn’t linear. You can’t, and won’t, know </span><b>everything</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> required for a role. We all take different paths to get to where we are, and you should be comfortable with that fact.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every role is different, and every organization will have different expectations for their candidates. But, regardless of your skill level, or the expectations of the role, you should:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be comfortable with your current skill level and experience.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Know that it’s acceptable to say “I don’t know”.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feel confident asking questions about things you don’t understand.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I believe these principles are not only essential for doing well in interviews, but can help you succeed in every role you will ever have, at every level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hope there is something you can take away from this article or perhaps you have had success with different strategies.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Gábor Baranyi</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">used to work as a personal trainer, and also held training sessions for groups at a gym. Since then, he has found something that fulfils him, and where he can develop continuously: he is working as a junior frontend developer at a medium-sized company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>I live here:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Szeged, Hungary</span></p>
<p><b>I work here:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Minero IT Hungary KFT.</span></p>
<p><b>Time spent studying with CodeBerry</b><b>:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 10 months</span></p>
<p><b>I work with:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Fujitsu Lifebook A555, Windows 7, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntelliJ_IDEA" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">IntelliJ</a>, <a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">SourceTree</a></span></p>
<p><b>When you’re asked about your profession, how do you answer?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It depends on who’s asking.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If it is a professional in the field, I say a frontend developer. If it is a layperson showing some interest, my answer is that I am a programmer or software developer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>What did you do for a living before you switched to web development?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I used to work full time as a personal trainer and held group training sessions at a functional gym. I still offer these group sessions, in addition to working as a programmer.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><b>Why did you decide to start learning web development?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">always been interested in web design, in how and why a website looks as it does. Besides that, the gym&#8217;s webpage was partly managed by us, trainers, so I spent a lot of time writing and designing our WordPress blog, which I really enjoyed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I spotted a good opportunity on Facebook, where they advertised an online web develop</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> course. I looked it up, and I knew that I have to master the ins and outs of this profession on this platform&#8230; or at least the basics of it. It was the advertisement of CodeBerry.</span></p>
<p><b>How did you learn programming? What kind of courses, books etc. did you use?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After seeing the above-mentioned advertisement, I started to study at CodeBerry&#8217;s online course in September 2016, and later I added Codecademy and Udemy courses to my learning resources as well. I searched for and learned specific programming languages on video sharing sites.</span></p>
<p><b>What did CodeBerry offer you? What was it like to study at our school?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was very useful. I really liked your monthly subscription system, because this way I could study at my own pace. I loved the explanations, the examples through which the tasks are presented.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-6606 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Gabor_Baranyi_pic1.jpeg" alt="This is how a frontend developer’s desk looks like" width="760" height="427" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Gabor_Baranyi_pic1.jpeg 760w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Gabor_Baranyi_pic1-300x169.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gábor’s Desk</span></p>
<p><b>Do you have any experience, tips or tricks to share with those who are just starting their studies?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I find it very important to learn the basics well and to revise the earlier lessons to see the connections </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and to be able to put the new material in context. Revision is crucial.</span></p>
<p><b>Tell me a little about where you work now, what your duties are. What do you do on a typical day or week?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, I work at a Budapest based company&#8217;s office in Szeged. We are developing an internal project where I deal with the frontend, consisting of <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/a-brief-introduction-to-web-development/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I arrive at the office around 8 a.m. and I leave at 5 p.m. I try to do something different when I am not there; training or holding group training, so I can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">face the next working day energized and refreshed.</span></p>
<p><b>Who do you work with, and how do they help your work?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are currently about 20 people working in the office. I have a mentor helping me with my progress, who also supervises the project we are working on.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12018 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><b>What kind of software, tools or technologies do you work with currently?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The development environment is IntelliJ, for version control we use SourceTree and for repo, we use BitBucket.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the project, we use HTML, CSS (SCSS), jQuery, Angular JS, Angular Material and FUSE.</span></p>
<p><b>How long were you looking for a job? Was it hard to find a place to work?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actually, I was still studying when my friend suggest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ed that I s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">end my CV to the company he works for. They invited me for an int</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">erview, and a few weeks later they called me saying that they would like to work with me, based on my performance.</span></p>
<p><b>How was the interview process?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a brief introduction of the company, the interview continued in English, and it was my turn to introduce myself, talk a bit about my private life and about how and where I learned programming, also in English.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was followed by a technical part, where they assessed my knowledge and gave me a few logic tests to solve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The whole interview took about an hour.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12255 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><b>Do you have any advice for those who are currently preparing for a job interview?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is very important that everything you say has to be positive. Even if something negative comes up, try to talk about it from a positive aspect or perspective. Always stay confident, and show that you are able and willing to improve in any field.</span></p>
<p><b>What is the next step for you? What direction are you taking?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want to know as much about frontend development as possible and get a taste of backend development as well to see and understand the whole background process.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>János Farkas</strong> is a construction technician, an applied graphic artist and a baker by profession.<br />
He has been working as a junior frontend developer at Y-collective (a Hungarian company) since January.</p>
<p><strong>In this episode of <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/category/codeberry-student-stories/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Student Stories</a>, let us take you on a follow-up journey</strong> with a former CodeBerry Programming School student.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I live here</strong>: Pécs, Hungary</p>
<p><strong>I work here</strong>: <a href="https://y-collective.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Y-collective</a></p>
<p><strong>I studied at CodeBerry for this long</strong>: 2 months</p>
<p><strong>I use</strong>: PHPStorm, Stack Overflow, CSS-tricks, W3Schools</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>When you&#8217;re asked about your profession, how do you answer?</strong></h3>
<p>First of all, I say that I am a programmer, usually everyone understands this.<br />
In most cases, people are interested when I tell them my profession. So, I give more details by explaining that I prepare the user interface of web pages visible to users.<br />
Sometimes I work on server-side scripting too&#8230;</p>
<h3><strong>What did you do for a living before you switched to web development?</strong></h3>
<p>This is the first time I work as a website developer. However, I started to get familiar with this field much earlier.<br />
I&#8217;ve been interested in this field for the past 10 years, but I only started taking it seriously last year.<br />
So far I only created some smaller websites (and I would do these in a different way now <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ).<br />
As for my previous jobs, I worked in the trading sector for 10 years.<br />
As the manager of the bakery department of a 7000 square meter superstore, my task was to supervise production, procurement, schedules and anything related.<br />
So, it was quite a big change for me.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>Why did you decide to start studying web development?</strong></h3>
<p>I have always been fascinated by the software part of computer science.<br />
Each year, the internet and web-related technologies play a greater and greater role in our everyday life.<br />
This results in an urging need for more and more professional developers. I would like to take this chance. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h3><strong>Tell me a little about where you work now, what your duties are. What do you do on a typical day or week?</strong></h3>
<p>I work as a junior site builder at Y-collective. Our office is in downtown Pécs.<br />
At the beginning of the week, there is a project management meeting where the tasks are determined and assigned. So it is more or less clear what everyone is going to work on during the week and maybe the following week.<br />
We have a lot of projects, so we have quite a variety of tasks.<br />
And it may happen that some urgent matter or a bug comes up on an ad hoc basis.<br />
My days usually start around 6 a.m., with a coffee.<br />
While drinking it, I glance over the news or I read about something I was dealing with the previous day.<br />
I usually go to work by bike. The official working hours are from eight in the morning to four in the afternoon, plus at times I stay a half-hour or an hour longer.<br />
Besides developments we do changes, bug fixes, importing existing modules to other projects, administrative duties, database modification&#8230;<br />
We recently started to concentrate more on unique WordPress developments.<br />
At times it needs some research or a plugin change, so it&#8217;s not boring.<br />
What I use daily is PHP, HTML, CSS, SCSS/LESS, Javascript/jQuery, Node/Bower, Bootstrap, and git.<br />
There are weekly/biweekly internal training and meetups on some subject.</p>

<h3><strong>How long were you looking for a job? Was it hard to find a place to work?</strong></h3>
<p>After all, I wasn&#8217;t looking for a job for long. Or rather, I did not expect to be able to enter the world of IT within such a short period of time.<br />
<a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/im-adam-freisinger-the-founder-of-codeberry-and-this-is-how-i-work/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Adam Freisinger</a>, one of the mentors at CodeBerry asked me about my professional goals, as I was making good progress with the materials.<br />
I didn&#8217;t keep it a secret that I intended to work in this field, so he organized an interview for me, then I got a trial task, and later a job.<br />
Hereby I&#8217;d like to thank everyone for the support, I&#8217;ll do my best to make up for it <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h3><strong>How did you learn programming? What kind of courses, books etc. did you use?</strong></h3>
<p>At first, I researched online materials, read articles and did tutorials.<br />
Then there was even more self-studying and then the next step was CodeBerry.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12018 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>What did CodeBerry offer you? What was it like to study at our school?</strong></h3>
<p>I was looking for an online course that could help me get to the next level. But for various reasons, none of them seemed really good.<br />
Then I stumbled upon CodeBerry.<br />
I really liked the approach: they not only realized that individuals need this course, but also that the IT sector is in need of junior professionals.<br />
A symbiotic relationship is built from this approach, which serves everyone&#8217;s needs.<br />
Studying is completely personalized: everyone can progress at their own pace. If someone is stuck, help is available from the Slack community, and Amanda.<br />
I wouldn&#8217;t say that I found very many new pieces of information in the teaching material, but for me, it was very useful for revising, for filling in the gaps I had, for deepening my knowledge&#8230;<br />
Personally, the extra service CodeBerry provided me was that I could assess my knowledge quite well, so I was more confident to make the decision to try myself out.</p>
<h3><strong>Do you have any experience, tips or tricks to share with those who are just starting their studies?</strong></h3>
<p>Start a side project while studying. Give a solution to a real problem, no matter how small it may be.<br />
You can learn a lot this way.<br />
Feel free to copy a solution or parts of it, but plan your own version and analyze and understand the parts that are not obvious to you.<br />
Even the scope of your studies can be built on this.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12255 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>What is the next step for you? What direction are you taking?</strong></h3>
<p>First of all, I definitely want to deepen my knowledge and catch up with my colleagues.<br />
We have a very well-prepared and seasoned team. Everyone is really good at what they do, and I learn a lot from them every day.<br />
Then I want to reach my own limits, and then&#8230; we&#8217;ll see.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Árpád Binecz</strong> (Bini) started as an embedded software engineer, worked at a startup, founded his own company and now, with a twist, he’s creating websites as a junior site builder. Enjoy our interview with one of our former students in the second episode of &#8220;<a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/category/codeberry-student-stories/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">CodeBerry Student Stories&#8221;.</a></p>
<h3><strong>What was your job before you shifted to web development?</strong></h3>
<p>I have a degree in electrical engineering. I worked as an embedded software engineer at an automotive company for four years. I also worked at a startup as well as starting my own leisure time managing company that I&#8217;ve since sold.</p>
<h3><strong>What does an embedded software engineer do?</strong></h3>
<p>An embedded software engineer develops circuits, not for computers, but rather for microwaves or cars. These circuits make things happen with a push of a button.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>Did your original profession make studying any easier?</strong></h3>
<p>Quite a bit, e.g. in algorithmic thinking.</p>
<h3><strong>Why did you decide to switch to web development?</strong></h3>
<p>First of all, I was really interested in IoT (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Internet of Things – ed.</a>) I knew the tools pretty well due to my original profession, but I had no idea how things would appear in a browser. I was curious. After all, I studied to become an engineer because I like understanding things. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Secondly, I would like to continue entrepreneurship and this topic seems just right for that: by starting with some unique websites than creating a small digital agency. A lot of people did the same thing in my environment and it looks like an accomplishable and rather cool path to walk.</p>
<h3><strong>When you&#8217;re asked about your profession, how do you answer?</strong></h3>
<p>Depends on who’s asking — someone laic or a friend of mine from tech school. In the first case, I’m an IT newbie. Otherwise, a junior site builder.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12018 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3>What does that mean? How does your typical day pass?</h3>
<p>We develop big IT systems at Apertus Kft.; I’m responsible for a small part of that. Keeping it simple: I receive ready designs and turn them into websites. I work on the looks, but for example, a clickable button is not my job.</p>
<p>To be a bit metaphoric, this is how I would describe the site builder profession: it’s a great jumpstart, with a kind of knowledge that sticks fast and makes it possible to stand with two feet on the quaggy ground of web technologies as well as the IT labor market.</p>
<h3><strong>Which languages do you use daily?</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/a-brief-introduction-to-web-development/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">HTML5, CSS3, SCSS, and Bootstrap.</a> I also used JQuery once. As a site builder, I create the pieces that the lead developer then uses to complete the website.</p>

<h3><strong>Do you enjoy your job? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong></h3>
<p>Yes. My colleagues are fun. I’m just a little unsatisfied with myself because I feel I could do better and learn faster.</p>
<h3><strong>How long did you spend looking for a job?</strong></h3>
<p>I left my previous job in June, started studying in July, and was working by the beginning of September. I got an offer through friends.</p>
<h3><strong>Did you use anything else than CodeBerry for your studies?</strong></h3>
<p>No, only CodeBerry.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12255 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>Can you give advice to newbies as a former student?</strong></h3>
<p>I think it’s worth having an overview of the whole field before choosing a technology and diving deep into that. It’s enough to know the smallest sellable unit thoroughly instead of knowing a little bit of everything.</p>
<p>For instance, HTML5, CSS3, SCSS and Bootstrap are a great combo. You can easily become a junior developer with those.</p>

I had to quit doing it because the libraries cited by the author didn’t exist anymore, so the tasks were unsolvable. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></p>
<h3><strong>Where did the idea of web development come from? </strong></h3>

I work in a bigger team, developing an application relying mainly on frontend technologies and designing the user interface.

Back then I had no clue about what I was about to dive into, but I said yes and I soon got the hang of it. Eventually, we finished the project, but web development had caught my attention, so I continued learning it on my own. Finally, I ran into a dead-end in spring, when I felt I can’t go on alone, I need a teacher. That’s when I found you. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </span></p>

Giving lectures or taking part in some more specific program, I don’t know yet, nor do I know how it’s going to happen, but I’m sure it will happen somehow. </span></p>
<h3><strong>As a well-experienced student, do you have any tips for those just starting to code? </strong></h3>

Programming is a big challenge, not easy in the beginning. But once you’ve got the hang of it and understand the logic, it all becomes clear. From that point onwards everything speeds up. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>László Békéssy</strong> graduated as an electrical engineer and now works as a developer and robot engineer besides being co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">CodeBerry Programming School</a>. During the interview, we gained insights about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-modifying_code" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">self-writing codes,</a> projects Laci fell in love with, prejudices he experienced in IT, and why he thinks total freedom is important at work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>I live here</strong>: Budapest, Hungary</em></p>
<p><em><strong>I work here</strong>: CodeBerry Programming School</em></p>
<p><em><strong>I work with</strong>: iPhone, Dell, Windows + my computer’s full of UNIX systems</em></p>
<p><em><strong>My work style in one word</strong>: ready. (It’s hard to describe this in one word because “ready” has a different meaning for everyone. Let me quote Marsellus Wallace: if it’s ready, it’s ready. There’s nothing more to do with it.)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h4><strong>When you&#8217;re asked about your profession, how do you answer?</strong></h4>
<p>I start to philosophize about the meanings of profession, vocation, and work, and I ask back if the person has found his vocation yet. I don’t like to answer this question though because it’s the second most popular small talk after “How’s it going?”, and I prefer deeper conversations than that. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Otherwise, I usually say I’m a school director (CodeBerry) as well as an automation expert, creating automation bots.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h4><strong>Tell me more about what you do regarding programming?</strong></h4>
<p>I automate tasks that occur more than three times.</p>
<p>Within a product (CodeBerry to be precise), clients have long and diverse life cycles. We have to follow them around from the point of arriving on the site and clicking a button.</p>
<p>My task is to make sure an interaction happens when a potential student arrives on our website, of course, in a fully automated way. For example, I ensure:</p>
<ul>
<li>They can register and receive the confirmation emails.</li>
<li>They can pay.</li>
<li>They are measured with analytics.</li>
<li>They receive the correct automatic emails whenever needed.</li>
<li>They receive an invoice.</li>
<li>We can follow which campaign they found us through and which ones work.</li>
<li>They can’t access our sites after deleting their subscription and they receive a refund if requested.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, I perform plenty of other background tasks to make our products as reliable as possible. It isn’t easy to secure that a server meltdown is followed by resetting everything to the exact copy of the old server but it’s a completely automated thing. This way we sleep safe and sound each night.</p>
<h4><strong>How does your workspace look like?</strong></h4>
<p>Mostly I work from a home office, sometimes from a café, but that’s a less comfortable solution. There are three important things by my desk: my laptop (obviously), a pair of headphones (I always listen to music during work, not kidding, always) and two different kinds of chairs (I sit a lot, therefore, swap them from time to time).</p>
<p>I’m planning to invest in a standing desk; it would definitely improve my work style. Oh and there’s often tea or water by my side to make sure I drink and get up more often.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-5813 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Laszlo_Bekessy_pic1-2.jpeg" alt="This is how a desk of a real robot engineer looks like" width="800" height="600" />Laci’s desk (Credit: László Békéssy)</p>
<h4><strong>When, where, and how did you learn to code?</strong></h4>
<p>During IT classes in university. I actually started learning it when I was 14, but I didn’t find it interesting until the end of university when we started learning about self-generating codes and automation robots. If we translate my philosophy in a positive way, I would say I want many IT specialists to work on useful things instead of continuing whatever they do now. If we want to be harsher, we could just say I want to stop the jobs of a lot of IT guys. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h4><strong>What are the job opportunities for web developers? On average, how much time did you spend looking for a job?</strong></h4>
<p>I never looked. Engineers, developers, IT specialists and electrical engineers are always needed. By the way, I have a degree in electrical engineering, with a hint of IT (embedded systems).</p>
<h4><strong>What is your schedule like?</strong></h4>
<p>My typical weekly routine looks something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monday: I spend the whole day with meetings (setting strategy and operative tasks) to get rid of them for the rest of the week.</li>
<li>Tuesday: there’s a long-term strategic discussion in the morning, later I usually meet with whoever I have to.</li>
<li>Wednesday-Thursday: I’m at home all day and nobody bothers me. Sometimes, I work 10-12 hours, although when I have some other things to do, I work “only” 6. These are net durations, excluding lunch, having conversations, or time spent in the bathroom.</li>
<li>Friday: we start with summarizing the week and then we plan the next one. My afternoon tasks vary.</li>
<li>Saturday-Sunday: 80% of the time, they’re free. But, as an entrepreneur, sometimes I just have to work full-time.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is approximately how my last year has passed. I&#8217;m very satisfied with this flexible routine because I’m in charge of my work hours, and I don’t have to travel to an office all the time. I always have a few days when I can work without disturbance. This is every developers’ dream.</p>
<h4><strong>What surprised you about this job that you never thought of before?</strong></h4>
<p>I would never have guessed that one day I’ll end up programming this much. But I’m happy about the opportunity to create things, especially when I work on projects that I’m motivated about from within.</p>
<h4><strong>Is there something you know that would surprise everyday people?</strong></h4>
<p>Sadly people tend to drop the conversation after hearing the words “IT” and “programming”, saying they’re not good at maths. However, I think IT is interesting and not that complex, not to mention that it’s something you can talk about in a way everyone could understand. My friend and I like to compete with each other, trying to explain the most difficult IT-, physics- and maths-related concepts with a cat and a box (inspired by Schrödinger’s cat) to just about anyone. With one exception (convolution), we could manage everything so far. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Steering back to the question, anything I’m interested in regarding IT can surprise (or bore) everyday people.</p>
<p>Especially the automation part:</p>
<p><em>“-Can you do a program that will download all your photos from your phone to your computer, rename them, order them by date, and upload them to the internet?”</em></p>
<p><em>“-Yep, just give me 10 minutes.”</em></p>
<h4><strong>Who do you work with?</strong></h4>
<p>I work with the co-founders of CodeBerry. The team has a history. We’ve been working together for 8 years and we have other favourite projects too: Invisible University, <a href="https://yearcompass.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">YearCompass</a> and SotePedia, just to bring some bigger examples.</p>
<h4><strong>What are the typical career paths in your profession?</strong></h4>
<p>I don’t have a good answer to this question because my weekly tasks usually involve four-five professions. We call these “hats” in the company because, before each task, we declare who’s wearing which hat, meaning what are we ready to do at that moment. Building the company, speaking to the accountant, configuring servers, creating a strategy, or writing codes all require different skills.</p>
<p>Introducing ourselves by declaring our &#8220;hats&#8221; is a funny ritual we do before every meeting. It&#8217;s a fun yet challenging part of entrepreneurship.</p>
<h4><strong>What are your plans, how do you wish to continue?</strong></h4>
<p>We’re focused 100% on CodeBerry at the moment. We’re planning on becoming international so that’s very exciting. The rest lies within the mystery of the future. We’ll see.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12028 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h4><strong>What other profession would you choose if you had to change? Could you change?</strong></h4>
<p>I wouldn’t like to change.</p>
<p>Five years ago I reevaluated important aspects of work. This is what I came up with:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can manage my own time. No need for an entry card system.</li>
<li>I can work on projects I find are worth it and have benefits.</li>
<li>I work with people who perform above expectations.</li>
<li>I work with people who communicate well.</li>
<li>I work on projects with a big impact on others.</li>
<li>My job brings passive income. If I want, I can stop anytime.</li>
<li>My workplace is no more than 15-20 minutes away from my home.</li>
<li>I can work from home if I wish.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, my current job meets all of the above.</p>
<h4><strong>What skills do great developers, IT experts require? Who do you not recommend this profession to?</strong></h4>
<p>I think you can only be good if you like what you’re doing. Luckily by now, programming has become a bit like swimming: you can try it, so do it if you like it, and leave it if you don’t. If you like accounting or serving food, do it; if you don’t, leave it. You know what I mean.</p>
<p>So just give things a go, stretch beyond your capabilities, and then love it or leave it.</p>
<h4><strong>What’s your favourite part?</strong></h4>
<p>Creating, and focusing on things.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, I always listen to music during work because this way it takes me no more than 5 minutes to reach the state where I can concentrate fully on one thing. I listen to female vocal trance, chill step, or progressive trance—they have a tempo similar to my brainwaves.</p>
<h4><strong>What grinds your gears most? What are the difficulties and dangers of your profession?</strong></h4>
<p>Some days, everything is on track. Every line of code I write works, everything is smooth, and I finish all tasks I wanted to. In fact, I complete some extra things too. These are the days I keep a record of in my calendar; there are two of them each year.</p>
<p>The rest are rougher. Twenty percent of my work is effective programming and 80 is more of debugging and testing. In some extreme cases, I turn to the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">StackOverflow</a> community asking for a solution and run their suggested lines without even knowing what they do.</p>
<p>I really don’t recommend this profession to those who don’t like investigating and discovering. These are necessary to find that missing space in the code that stops the whole thing from running properly. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h4><strong>How stable is your job? How much time does one spend working for the same company?</strong></h4>
<p>My job is stable. I’m the boss.</p>
<p>To be honest, I’ve never worked for more than 2-3 years at the same place or on the same project and I’m planning to continue with this tendency.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12255 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h4><strong>If you had to ask for one thing in the name of all developers, what would it be?</strong></h4>
<p>Give programming a go, you might like it. In which case, you’ll probably live a much better life than now.</p>
<h4><strong>How much can one earn in this profession (as a newbie, experienced and veteran)?</strong></h4>
<p>I started my career at a multinational company so I was paid the typical amount at the bottom of those ladders.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t say I’m experienced or a veteran, but with my current knowledge, I would probably be hired for an annual $30,000 wage. This doesn’t have to be a developer job, rather a tech team leader or middle management.</p>
<h4><strong>What do you think is the best way to learn to code?</strong></h4>
<p>Choose a project off your “I should” list (a bucket list of things you should do, but of course you never have time…), and program it.</p>
<h4><strong>What makes code worth learning?</strong></h4>
<p>It’s not worth it unless you really like to do it.</p>
<p>But it’s definitely worth forgetting the thought that you can only be a good developer if you like maths and physics. That’s just not how it works. I have pharmacist, economist, artist and painter friends who like to code. Some of them do it for money, others are motivated by self-fulfilment. You should try it too.</p>
