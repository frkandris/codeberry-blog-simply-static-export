										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nowadays, we don’t use the internet just for getting information, reading, watching videos and movies, or listening to music—we also shape the content by using social media, posting, commenting, chatting, using web applications, shopping in online stores, planning routes, and so on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Complex development teams work together to operate the many functions above—different members are responsible for different areas, and they are using various technologies and programming languages to achieve this. At a well-chosen web development course, you can learn all the know-how of this segment.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12017 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main areas of web development</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Web development is usually separated into two big areas (front-end and back-end),</strong> and there’s another term for people who have <strong>comprehensive knowledge of both areas (full stack).</strong> In this article, we collected courses that can help you learn about these areas of web development and acquire the skills necessary to work in these fields.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Front-end</span></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/326514/pexels-photo-326514.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;dpr=2&amp;h=750&amp;w=1260" alt="web development courses" width="503" height="336" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the areas of web development is front-end development, i.e., the <strong>creation and maintenance of interfaces seen by the user.</strong> Client-side programming means creating and maintaining dynamic and responsive websites using plans from graphic artists and designers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a front-end developer, <strong>you have to be familiar with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</strong> In addition, it is also useful to know <strong>frameworks and libraries like Angular, jQuery, or React.</strong></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back-end</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another web development area we usually talk about separately is back-end development which means <strong>server-side programming and maintenance</strong>. Back-end developers create background processes and build communication with databases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some often-used server-side programming languages:<strong> Java, PHP, SQL, Python, Ruby, Node.js, ASP.NET. </strong></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full-stack</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are <strong>IT specialists that are familiar with both back-end and front-end development</strong>, i.e., they understand the whole web development process. Both background processes and the maintenance of user interfaces require complex knowledge, therefore front-end, back-end, and full-stack developers are all sought-after on the labour market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can read more about </span><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/introduction-to-web-development/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the basics of web development</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if you need more information.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web development courses</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are interested in this area and would like to work as a web developer, <strong>you should apply to a course</strong> you like and start learning web languages. The courses listed in this post have different goals, so they teach different technologies. In time, it will become important to make clear what you want to do so that you can learn things accordingly.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. </span><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/hu/weboldal-keszites-tanfolyam/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CodeBerry &#8211; Website Creation Course </span></a><i></i></h3>
<ul>

<li><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">From beginner level</span></i></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can learn the<strong> basics of HTML, CSS3,</strong> and the use of online and offline editors during the course. After successfully completing it, you will be able to create modern websites by yourself. The course is online, and <strong>experienced mentors help you</strong> along the way if you get stuck. You can learn individually, and according to your schedule. <strong>No prior knowledge is required</strong>—just your interest and commitment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you already have some basic knowledge, we also recommend our </span><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/hu/weboldal-keszites-gyakorlofeladatok-tanfolyam/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Website Creation Practice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> course where you can strengthen your knowledge so that you can create websites more confidently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <strong>The course takes up 5 hours of your time per week,</strong> and you can create exciting new interfaces, e.g., the main page of a blog or the user interface of a chat app. You will get constant feedback on your work from the mentors so that your development becomes even faster.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I always wanted to know how I can create a great website since I had blogs, personal websites, journals, yet I could never make them my own through formatting. I had minimal HTML knowledge when I started the Website Creation module, and it is incredible how much I learned from it even on the first day. I am grateful for the opportunity to access these fantastic lessons anytime, anywhere, with completely understandable materials at a reasonable price.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” &#8211; Attila Szabó (Facebook)</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Coursera provides you:</span></i></p>
<ul>

<li><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specialization possibilities</span></i></li>

<li><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certificate options</span></i></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Coursera there are<strong> plenty of useful courses on different levels, durations and languages,</strong> you can filter them by every important segment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides <strong>beginner, intermediate and advanced</strong> levels there are also <strong>mixed courses</strong> – this last one is for those who already have a basic programming background and now the goal is to broaden their knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You also can choose from <strong>complete courses</strong> or just <strong>specializations</strong> depending on your goals and preferences.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like Coursera, Edx also collects several courses of programming, where you can find the perfect fit for your study level and for your demands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At EDx you can select from <strong>courses or complete programs,</strong> the last ones are mostly provided by Universities so you can take official undergraduate courses and get certificates from Harvard, UCLA or NYU, which looks really good on your resume. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>LinkedIn has a learning platform</strong> as well, which is known also as Lynda.com.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides <strong>detached programming courses,</strong> Lynda.com offers <strong>complete learning paths.</strong> If you’d like to start studying and have long-term plans to improve your skills, but some extra guidelines would be helpful, you can choose this option. In this case, you don’t have to worry about creating learning plans and search fitting courses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have already found your favourite course, <strong>you have the opportunity to follow all of the content provided by the same author.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also <strong>search for applied software</strong> which is really useful if you need to learn fast about a new framework or technique which is needed for your next project.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Pluralsight you also have the option to choose from <strong>complete learning paths,</strong> which generally <strong>contains 6-9 courses</strong> in order to get f<strong>rom a beginner level to intermediate or advanced.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your goal is just to get familiar with web development tools first, you can choose a <strong>single beginner course</strong>, but there are also <strong>specializations</strong> which are useful if you already code and need some extra knowledge for a project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pluralsight has a <strong>monthly fee to use,</strong> but there are other options as well, like <strong>annual billing and premium access,</strong> which provides you with more <strong>interactive content and extended materials.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pluralsight has also a Twitter channel where you can get feedback from the students about the course quality:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SkillShare provides a<strong> wide range of courses</strong> not just from the field of IT but also about filming, photography, marketing or soft skills as productivity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can<strong> filter by whole topics</strong> like web development, but in every search result, you’ll find <strong>further tags which separate the courses</strong> into smaller groups, so you don’t have to scroll down for hours, just pick the right tag and see the courses you’re interested in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’d like to give a try, SkillShare gives you <strong>unlimited free access for the first 7 days,</strong> and if you like their materials, you have the chance to upgrade your account for a monthly fee.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is worth checking the course list regularly, in order to find the ideal materials discounted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this option, most courses start from a very pleasant <strong>13.99 € price,</strong> and contain <strong>online or live-performed educational materials</strong> – but if you‘re unlucky, you could find 2-300€ course prices.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Gábor Baranyi</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">used to work as a personal trainer, and also held training sessions for groups at a gym. Since then, he has found something that fulfils him, and where he can develop continuously: he is working as a junior frontend developer at a medium-sized company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>I live here:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Szeged, Hungary</span></p>
<p><b>I work here:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Minero IT Hungary KFT.</span></p>
<p><b>Time spent studying with CodeBerry</b><b>:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 10 months</span></p>
<p><b>I work with:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Fujitsu Lifebook A555, Windows 7, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntelliJ_IDEA" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">IntelliJ</a>, <a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">SourceTree</a></span></p>
<p><b>When you’re asked about your profession, how do you answer?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It depends on who’s asking.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If it is a professional in the field, I say a frontend developer. If it is a layperson showing some interest, my answer is that I am a programmer or software developer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>What did you do for a living before you switched to web development?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I used to work full time as a personal trainer and held group training sessions at a functional gym. I still offer these group sessions, in addition to working as a programmer.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><b>Why did you decide to start learning web development?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">always been interested in web design, in how and why a website looks as it does. Besides that, the gym&#8217;s webpage was partly managed by us, trainers, so I spent a lot of time writing and designing our WordPress blog, which I really enjoyed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I spotted a good opportunity on Facebook, where they advertised an online web develop</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> course. I looked it up, and I knew that I have to master the ins and outs of this profession on this platform&#8230; or at least the basics of it. It was the advertisement of CodeBerry.</span></p>
<p><b>How did you learn programming? What kind of courses, books etc. did you use?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After seeing the above-mentioned advertisement, I started to study at CodeBerry&#8217;s online course in September 2016, and later I added Codecademy and Udemy courses to my learning resources as well. I searched for and learned specific programming languages on video sharing sites.</span></p>
<p><b>What did CodeBerry offer you? What was it like to study at our school?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was very useful. I really liked your monthly subscription system, because this way I could study at my own pace. I loved the explanations, the examples through which the tasks are presented.</span></p>

<p><b>Do you have any experience, tips or tricks to share with those who are just starting their studies?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I find it very important to learn the basics well and to revise the earlier lessons to see the connections </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and to be able to put the new material in context. Revision is crucial.</span></p>
<p><b>Tell me a little about where you work now, what your duties are. What do you do on a typical day or week?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, I work at a Budapest based company&#8217;s office in Szeged. We are developing an internal project where I deal with the frontend, consisting of <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/a-brief-introduction-to-web-development/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I arrive at the office around 8 a.m. and I leave at 5 p.m. I try to do something different when I am not there; training or holding group training, so I can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">face the next working day energized and refreshed.</span></p>
<p><b>Who do you work with, and how do they help your work?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are currently about 20 people working in the office. I have a mentor helping me with my progress, who also supervises the project we are working on.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12018 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><b>What kind of software, tools or technologies do you work with currently?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The development environment is IntelliJ, for version control we use SourceTree and for repo, we use BitBucket.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the project, we use HTML, CSS (SCSS), jQuery, Angular JS, Angular Material and FUSE.</span></p>
<p><b>How long were you looking for a job? Was it hard to find a place to work?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actually, I was still studying when my friend suggest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ed that I s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">end my CV to the company he works for. They invited me for an int</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">erview, and a few weeks later they called me saying that they would like to work with me, based on my performance.</span></p>
<p><b>How was the interview process?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a brief introduction of the company, the interview continued in English, and it was my turn to introduce myself, talk a bit about my private life and about how and where I learned programming, also in English.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was followed by a technical part, where they assessed my knowledge and gave me a few logic tests to solve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The whole interview took about an hour.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12255 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><b>Do you have any advice for those who are currently preparing for a job interview?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is very important that everything you say has to be positive. Even if something negative comes up, try to talk about it from a positive aspect or perspective. Always stay confident, and show that you are able and willing to improve in any field.</span></p>
<p><b>What is the next step for you? What direction are you taking?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want to know as much about frontend development as possible and get a taste of backend development as well to see and understand the whole background process.</span></p>

<ul>
<li class="entry-title"><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/interview-tips-that-will-give-you-confidence-and-help-you-land-a-dev-job/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Interview tips that will give you confidence and help you land a dev job</a></li>

</ul>
<h3><b>Before you learn to code, think about what you want to code</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing how to code is mostly about building things, and the path is a lot clearer when you have a sense of the end goal. If your goal is “learn to code,” without a clear idea of the kinds of programs you will write and how they will make your life better, you will probably find it a frustrating exercise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m a little ashamed to admit that part of my motivation for studying computer science was that I wanted to prove I was smart, and I wanted to be able to get Smart Person jobs. I also liked thinking about math and theory (</span><a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Godel-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this book</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> blew my mind at an impressionable age) and the program was a good fit. It wasn’t enough to sustain me for long, though, until I found ways to connect technology to the things I really loved, like music and literature.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what do you want to code? Websites? Games? iPhone apps? A startup that makes you rich? Interactive art? Do you want to be able to impress your boss or automate a tedious task so you can spend more time looking at otter pictures? Perhaps you simply want to be more employable, add a buzzword to your resume, or fulfill the requirements of your educational program. All of these are worthy goals. Make sure you know which one is yours, and study accordingly.</span></p>
<h3><b>There’s nothing mystical about it</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coding is a skill like any other. Like language learning, there’s grammar and vocabulary to acquire. Like math, there are processes to work through specific types of problems. Like all kinds of craftsmanship and art-making, there are techniques and tools and best practices that people have developed over time, specialized to different tasks, that you’re free to use or modify or discard.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/ThePerilsofJavaSchools.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This guy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (a very smart guy! Whose other writings I enjoy and frequently agree with!) posits that there is a bright line between people with the True Mind of a Programmer and everyone else, who are lacking the intellectual capacity needed to succeed in the field. That bright line consists, according to him, of pointers and recursion (there are primers </span><a href="http://alumni.cs.ucr.edu/~pdiloren/C++_Pointers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://inventwithpython.com/blog/2011/08/11/recursion-explained-with-the-flood-fill-algorithm-and-zombies-and-cats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the curious).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I learned about pointers and recursion in school, and when I understood them, it was a delightful jolt to my brain — the kind of intellectual pleasure that made me want to study computer science in the first place. But, outside of classroom exercises, the number of times I’ve had to be familiar with either concept to get things done has been relatively small. And when helping others learn, over and over again, I’ve watched people complete interesting and rewarding projects without knowing anything about either one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no point in being intimidated or wondering if you’re Smart Enough. Sure, the more complex and esoteric your task, the higher the level of mastery you will need to complete it. But this is true in absolutely every other field. Unless you’re planning to make your living entirely by your code, chances are you don’t have to be a recursion-understanding genius to make the thing you want to make.</span></p>
<h3><b>It never works the first time</b></h3>
<h4><b>And probably won’t the second or third time</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you first start learning to code, you’ll very quickly run up against this particular experience: you think you’ve set up everything the way you’re supposed to, you’ve checked and re-checked it, and it still. doesn’t. work. You don’t have a clue where to begin trying to fix it, and the error message (if you’re lucky enough to have one at all) might as well say “fuck you.” You might be tempted to give up at this point, thinking that you’ll never figure it out, that you’re not cut out for this. I had that feeling the first time I tried to write a program in C++, ran it, and got only the words “segmentation fault” for my trouble.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this experience is so common for programmers of all skill levels that it says absolutely nothing about your intelligence, tech-savviness, or suitability for the coding life. It will happen to you as a beginner, but it will also happen to you as an experienced programmer. The main difference will be in how you respond to it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve found that a big difference between new coders and experienced coders is faith: faith that things are going wrong for a logical and discoverable reason, faith that problems are fixable, faith that there is a way to accomplish the goal. The path from “not working” to “working” might not be obvious, but with patience you can usually find it.</span></p>

But </span><a href="http://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2013/06/01/roc-rocks.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">good code doesn’t need comments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are almost always many different approaches to a particular problem, with no single “right way.” A lot of programmers get very good at advocating for their preferred way, but that doesn’t mean it’s the One True Path. Going head-to-head with people telling me I was Wrong, and trying to figure out if they were right, was one of the more stressful aspects of my early career.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re coding in a team with other people, someone will almost certainly take issue with something that you’re doing. Sometimes they’ll be absolutely correct, and it’s always worth investigating to see whether you are, in fact, Doing It Wrong. But sometimes they will be full of shit or re-enacting an ancient and meaningless dispute where it would be best to just follow a style guide and forget about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, if you’re the kind of person who enjoys ancient but meaningless disputes (grammar nerds, I’m looking at you), you’ve come to the right place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Coding” means a lot of different things to a lot of different people, and it looks different now from how it used to. And, funnily enough, the tools and packages and frameworks that make it faster and easier for newcomers or even trained developers to build things are most likely to be tarred with the “not for REAL coders” brush. (See: “</span><a href="http://blog.enfranchisedmind.com/2009/04/return-of-the-real-programmer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Return of the Real Programmer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">”)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behind all this is the fear that </span><a href="http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2013/08/21/chase-felker-youre-not-a-computer-programmer-and-thats-ok/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">if “anyone” can call themselves a programmer, the title will become meaningless</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But I think that this gatekeeping is destructive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the tools that make it easiest to build the things you want to build. If that means your game was made in Stencyl or GameMaker rather than written from scratch, that’s fine. If your first foray into coding is HTML or Excel macros, that’s fine. Work with something you feel you can stick with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you get more comfortable, you’ll naturally start to find those tools limiting rather than helpful and look for more powerful ones. But most of the time, few people will ever even look at your code or even ask what you used — It’s what you make with it that counts.</span></p>
<h3><b>Worrying about “geek cred” will slowly kill you</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">See above. I used to worry a lot, especially in school, about whether I was identifying myself as “not a real geek” (and therefore less worthy of inclusion in tech communities) through my clothing, my presentation, my choice of reading material and even my software customization choices. It was a terrible waste of energy and I became a lot more functional after I made the decision to let it all go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to internalize this: your ability to get good at coding has </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">nothing</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to do with how well you fit into the various geek subcultures. This goes double if you know deep down that you’ll never quite fit. The energy you spend proving yourself should be going into making things instead. And, if you’re an indisputable geek with cred leaking from your eye sockets, keep this in mind for when you’re evaluating someone else’s cred level. It may not mean what you think it does.</span></p>

<h3><b>Sticking with it is more important than the method</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no shortage of articles about the “right” or “best” way to learn how to code, and there are lots of potential approaches. You can learn the concepts </span><a href="http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">from a book</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or by </span><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">completing interactive exercises</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or by </span><a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/intro.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">debugging things that others have written</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And, of course, there are lots of languages you might choose as your first to learn, with advocates for each.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A common complaint with “teach yourself to code” programs and workshops is that you’ll breeze happily through the beginner material and then hit a steep curve where things get more difficult very quickly. You know how to print some lines of text on a page but have no idea where to start working on a “real,” useful project. You might feel like you were just following directions without really understanding and blame the learning materials.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12255 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you get to this stage, most of the tutorials and online resources available to you are much less useful because they assume you’re already an experienced and comfortable programmer. The difficulty is further compounded by the fact that “you don’t know what you don’t know.” Even trying to figure out what to learn next is a puzzle in itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll hit this wall no matter what “learn to code” program you follow, and the only way to get past it is to persevere. This means you keep trying new things, learning more information, and figuring out, piece by piece, how to build your project. You’re a lot more likely to find success in the end if you have a clear idea of why you’re learning to code in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you keep putting bricks on top of each other, it might take a long time but eventually, you’ll have a wall. This is where that faith I mentioned earlier comes in handy. If you believe that with time and patience you can figure the whole coding thing out, in time you almost certainly will. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

<h3><b>What is programming?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose that you work for a multinational company and you have an upcoming meeting with a businessman from China. Your native language is [insert local language] and you don’t speak a word of Chinese. However, you remember that your second language is English and that the Chinese businessman speaks English as well. You then begin to use English as a common language to negotiate and communicate with each other. </span></p>

<h3><b>What language do computers speak?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A computer’s native language is binary: an incredibly long list of 1’s and 0’s. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Binary</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> isn’t very easy for people to read or write, so we came up with programming languages to talk with computers, instead. Since computers don’t know human languages, we have to meet in the middle somewhere. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, unlike humans, computers aren’t able to pick up on indirect communication and always take things very literally. If you tell them something, they will do it exactly as they are told. Computers aren’t smart enough to make decisions on their own and won’t understand information that isn’t spelt out for them. For this reason, you need to make sure that you’re giving them exact instructions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if I told you to make a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sandwich</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you might ask me what ingredients I want on that sandwich and if I want it toasted or not. To you, that might be all you need to know to make me a delicious sandwich. However, there are many small decisions and previous knowledge involved in making a sandwich. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you simply tell a computer that you want a toasted ham and cheese sandwich with rye bread and mayonnaise, you might get something very different from what you ordered. A human would know that the mayonnaise goes on the slices of bread first, the ham and cheese are added second, then the sandwich is placed in the oven to be toasted. </span></p>
<h3><b>But, how is a computer supposed to know all</b> that?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember that we told the computer that we want, “a toasted ham and cheese sandwich with rye bread and mayonnaise.” To a computer, it might be logical to do all of those things in order. It would toast the ham and cheese by themselves, put two slices of rye bread on top, and then spread mayonnaise on the bread. </span></p>
<h3>Aren’t computers supposed to be smarter than that?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, because the computer takes things</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> literally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you have to specify the order of each step and the placement of each ingredient. Everyone knows that the ingredients go between the pieces of bread, but a computer has no previous knowledge of what a sandwich is like—it’s just following your direct instructions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is another reason why we can’t communicate with computers using human languages, just yet. Our languages are simply too ambiguous and too vague for a computer to understand properly. Also, if a word or a sentence might have a double meaning, a computer wouldn’t know how to interpret it. It needs everything spelt out for it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The truth is that computers aren’t smart at all; they just happen to process information faster than us. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6210" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/code.2-1.jpg" alt="" width="5472" height="3648" /></p>
<h3>What is a programmer and what do they do?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember, you can’t just tell the computer in English what you want. You’ll need a computer programmer to translate for you. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A computer programmer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a person who communicates your ideas and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">instructions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to a computer, making websites, games, and other programs appear on the screen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A programmer could also be defined as a polyglot (one who knows many languages) that specializes in talking to computers. They know exactly what to say and how to say it so that the computer will understand them. If you’ve ever learned another language, you know that each language comes with its own vocabulary, grammar, and set of rules. Computer languages also come with their own way of saying things, called syntax. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a person might understand you if you </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mispronounce</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a word, use the wrong conjugation, or mess up your grammar, a computer is a lot less forgiving with mistakes. As soon as you make a syntax error, the computer will stop listening to you and quit running the program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How rude. </span></p>
<h3>What are you able to accomplish with coding skills?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve ever used a computer, watched videos online, or played video games, it might be hard to believe that all of that comes from just a series of letters and symbols. The ability to process thousands of lines of code per second is the strength of a computer and allows it to follow highly complex instructions and accomplish incredible tasks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s take a look at some of the cool things you can do with code:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create &amp; Design Websites</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Build Mobile Apps</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Develop Desktop Programs</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Develop Video Games</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create &amp; Maintain Databases</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automate Tasks</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solve Complex Problems</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create Artificial Intelligence</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perform Statistical Analysis</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And much more&#8230;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re interested in any of these activities and would like to do them for a living, learning to program is definitely an important skill to have. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12028 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3>What makes coding useful and what is it good for?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we rely more and more on computers in our daily lives, the importance of computer programming and coding continues to grow as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the coming years, nearly all fields will involve computer programming and learning to code will give you an edge in your future career. For example, you can use programming skills in the areas of writing, analysis, management, engineering, software development, and so much more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advocates of programming see learning to code as a universal skill that everyone should have, such as the ability to read and write or perform simple mathematical equations. Many governments around the world believe this as well and have proposed initiatives to teach coding to kids alongside core curriculum in schools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like us, they see coding as the key to staying competitive in a global marketplace. </span></p>
<h3>I already know it’s useful, but what is programming actually like?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average day in the life of a programmer isn’t as glamorous as it might appear in movies or on television shows. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being a programmer requires a lot of concentration, patience, and a self-driven attitude. If you aren’t able to sit down and focus for hours at a time, you might want to reconsider pursuing a career in computer programming. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some programming jobs may require you to work on an irregular schedule and be available to fix bugs and solve problems immediately as they appear. Others may have you work from nine to five o’clock, just like a regular job. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, working as a computer programmer might give you more freedom than your current job allows. A good number of programming jobs are remote, meaning that you can code while at home, at a café, or while you get a tan at the beach—given that the wifi signal reaches that far. </span></p>
<h3>Is programming really right for me?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where the rubber meets the road and where you’ll have to seriously weigh the computer programmer pros and cons. Perhaps, you’ve had an unrealistic idea of what programming is like and haven’t considered that coding is just like any other job out there—it’s still hard work. However, if you meet the following criteria, chances are that you’ll love every second of it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Signs that Programming Isn’t Right for You:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are only motivated by money and aren’t interested in computers at all</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t like to sit down for long periods of time</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your eyes glaze over when you look at a page of code</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are relatively slow at typing and often make many typos</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Signs that Programming IS Right For You:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You describe yourself as both analytical AND creative</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have high attention to detail</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are comfortable working with others and working alone</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have a good basis for understanding written English</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You love problem-solving</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You love to always learn new things</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You adapt well to change</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You like to organize information and automate processes</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>What programming languages do I choose and where do I start?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s go back to the example of our meeting with the Chinese businessman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although English may be useful in a business setting, you might find that you need to learn other languages for different fields. For example, you might want to know French for diplomacy, Greek for philosophy, and German in the field of engineering. Depending on what field you work in, you will choose a specific language to meet your needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You won’t have the time or ability to learn every programming language out there, so you’ll need to be strategic about what languages you will learn. First, you need to determine what your focus is and what languages you need to know to accomplish your personal goals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While technically not programming languages, HTML and CSS are great languages to start with to begin learning the fundamentals of how programming works. HTML and CSS are “text markup languages” which are actually languages that we use to format and organize the text. Without HTML or CSS, your browser wouldn’t know if these words I’m writing are a headline, a paragraph, or a footer. It also wouldn’t know if these words should be bolded, italicized, etc. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even as I write this article, I am using HTML and CSS to help you and your internet browser understand what I have to say. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12019 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3>TL;DR (Too Long; Didn’t Read)</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In summary, programming is a high-paying career that requires patience, dedication, and extremely high attention to detail. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you hate sitting down at a computer and aren’t willing to put in the time to practice, you’ll likely hate programming and give up rather quickly. You also won’t do well if you are motivated by the paycheck and have no interest in the job itself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if you love learning new things, are self-motivated, and have a can-do attitude, you’ll succeed—regardless of your educational background.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>János Farkas</strong> is a construction technician, an applied graphic artist and a baker by profession.<br />
He has been working as a junior frontend developer at Y-collective (a Hungarian company) since January.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>I live here</strong>: Pécs, Hungary</p>
<p><strong>I work here</strong>: <a href="https://y-collective.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Y-collective</a></p>
<p><strong>I studied at CodeBerry for this long</strong>: 2 months</p>
<p><strong>I use</strong>: PHPStorm, Stack Overflow, CSS-tricks, W3Schools</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>When you&#8217;re asked about your profession, how do you answer?</strong></h3>
<p>First of all, I say that I am a programmer, usually everyone understands this.<br />
In most cases, people are interested when I tell them my profession. So, I give more details by explaining that I prepare the user interface of web pages visible to users.<br />
Sometimes I work on server-side scripting too&#8230;</p>
<h3><strong>What did you do for a living before you switched to web development?</strong></h3>
<p>This is the first time I work as a website developer. However, I started to get familiar with this field much earlier.<br />
I&#8217;ve been interested in this field for the past 10 years, but I only started taking it seriously last year.<br />
So far I only created some smaller websites (and I would do these in a different way now <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ).<br />
As for my previous jobs, I worked in the trading sector for 10 years.<br />
As the manager of the bakery department of a 7000 square meter superstore, my task was to supervise production, procurement, schedules and anything related.<br />
So, it was quite a big change for me.</p>

<h3><strong>Why did you decide to start studying web development?</strong></h3>
<p>I have always been fascinated by the software part of computer science.<br />
Each year, the internet and web-related technologies play a greater and greater role in our everyday life.<br />
This results in an urging need for more and more professional developers. I would like to take this chance. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h3><strong>Tell me a little about where you work now, what your duties are. What do you do on a typical day or week?</strong></h3>
<p>I work as a junior site builder at Y-collective. Our office is in downtown Pécs.<br />
At the beginning of the week, there is a project management meeting where the tasks are determined and assigned. So it is more or less clear what everyone is going to work on during the week and maybe the following week.<br />
We have a lot of projects, so we have quite a variety of tasks.<br />
And it may happen that some urgent matter or a bug comes up on an ad hoc basis.<br />
My days usually start around 6 a.m., with a coffee.<br />
While drinking it, I glance over the news or I read about something I was dealing with the previous day.<br />
I usually go to work by bike. The official working hours are from eight in the morning to four in the afternoon, plus at times I stay a half-hour or an hour longer.<br />
Besides developments we do changes, bug fixes, importing existing modules to other projects, administrative duties, database modification&#8230;<br />
We recently started to concentrate more on unique WordPress developments.<br />
At times it needs some research or a plugin change, so it&#8217;s not boring.<br />
What I use daily is PHP, HTML, CSS, SCSS/LESS, Javascript/jQuery, Node/Bower, Bootstrap, and git.<br />
There are weekly/biweekly internal training and meetups on some subject.</p>

<h3><strong>How long were you looking for a job? Was it hard to find a place to work?</strong></h3>
<p>After all, I wasn&#8217;t looking for a job for long. Or rather, I did not expect to be able to enter the world of IT within such a short period of time.<br />
<a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/im-adam-freisinger-the-founder-of-codeberry-and-this-is-how-i-work/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Adam Freisinger</a>, one of the mentors at CodeBerry asked me about my professional goals, as I was making good progress with the materials.<br />
I didn&#8217;t keep it a secret that I intended to work in this field, so he organized an interview for me, then I got a trial task, and later a job.<br />
Hereby I&#8217;d like to thank everyone for the support, I&#8217;ll do my best to make up for it <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h3><strong>How did you learn programming? What kind of courses, books etc. did you use?</strong></h3>
<p>At first, I researched online materials, read articles and did tutorials.<br />
Then there was even more self-studying and then the next step was CodeBerry.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12018 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>What did CodeBerry offer you? What was it like to study at our school?</strong></h3>
<p>I was looking for an online course that could help me get to the next level. But for various reasons, none of them seemed really good.<br />
Then I stumbled upon CodeBerry.<br />
I really liked the approach: they not only realized that individuals need this course, but also that the IT sector is in need of junior professionals.<br />
A symbiotic relationship is built from this approach, which serves everyone&#8217;s needs.<br />
Studying is completely personalized: everyone can progress at their own pace. If someone is stuck, help is available from the Slack community, and Amanda.<br />
I wouldn&#8217;t say that I found very many new pieces of information in the teaching material, but for me, it was very useful for revising, for filling in the gaps I had, for deepening my knowledge&#8230;<br />
Personally, the extra service CodeBerry provided me was that I could assess my knowledge quite well, so I was more confident to make the decision to try myself out.</p>
<h3><strong>Do you have any experience, tips or tricks to share with those who are just starting their studies?</strong></h3>
<p>Start a side project while studying. Give a solution to a real problem, no matter how small it may be.<br />
You can learn a lot this way.<br />
Feel free to copy a solution or parts of it, but plan your own version and analyze and understand the parts that are not obvious to you.<br />
Even the scope of your studies can be built on this.</p>

<h3><strong>What is the next step for you? What direction are you taking?</strong></h3>
<p>First of all, I definitely want to deepen my knowledge and catch up with my colleagues.<br />
We have a very well-prepared and seasoned team. Everyone is really good at what they do, and I learn a lot from them every day.<br />
Then I want to reach my own limits, and then&#8230; we&#8217;ll see.</p>

<h3><strong>When someone asked about your profession a few months ago, how did you answer? </strong></h3>
<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;I used to say my job is networking at IT Services, meaning that I helped big companies join the internet.

<h3><strong>And what is your answer now?</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>That sounds great! So, programming wasn’t really a new task for you, was it? Did you encounter coding earlier?</strong></h3>
<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;I’m a frontend UI developer at EPAM. I work in a bigger team, developing an application relying mainly on frontend technologies and designing the user interface. I use HTML, CSS and JavaScript on a daily basis.&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:384,&quot;10&quot;:1,&quot;11&quot;:3}">Yes, I actually started using HTML and CSS during elementary school. Later in high school, we used Python all the time, relying on an antique book. I had to quit doing it because the libraries cited by the author didn’t exist anymore, so the tasks were unsolvable. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></p>
<h3><strong>Where did the idea of web development come from? </strong></h3>
<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;I’m a frontend UI developer at EPAM. I work in a bigger team, developing an application relying mainly on frontend technologies and designing the user interface. I use HTML, CSS and JavaScript on a daily basis.&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:384,&quot;10&quot;:1,&quot;11&quot;:3}">During my senior year of high school, two guys approached me, saying they needed web developers for their startup. Back then I had no clue about what I was about to dive into, but I said yes and I soon got the hang of it. Eventually, we finished the project, but web development had caught my attention, so I continued learning it on my own. Finally, I ran into a dead-end in spring, when I felt I can’t go on alone, I need a teacher. That’s when I found you. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </span></p>

<h3><strong>How long have you been studying with CodeBerry? </strong></h3>
<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;I’m a frontend UI developer at EPAM. I work in a bigger team, developing an application relying mainly on frontend technologies and designing the user interface. I use HTML, CSS and JavaScript on a daily basis.&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:384,&quot;10&quot;:1,&quot;11&quot;:3}">Since June 2016. </span></p>
<h3><strong>And how did you like it, what were the advantages? </strong></h3>
<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;I’m a frontend UI developer at EPAM. I work in a bigger team, developing an application relying mainly on frontend technologies and designing the user interface.

The mentors helped me a lot – that was probably one of the best things in it. Having someone to discuss your problems with is a huge advantage. </span></p>

<p>That’s good to hear. Now it’s the beginning of autumn, that means you’ve gained enough knowledge in 3 months to find a job.</p>

Giving lectures or taking part in some more specific program, I don’t know yet, nor do I know how it’s going to happen, but I’m sure it will happen somehow. </span></p>
<h3><strong>As a well-experienced student, do you have any tips for those just starting to code? </strong></h3>

Programming is a big challenge, not easy in the beginning. But once you’ve got the hang of it and understand the logic, it all becomes clear. From that point onwards everything speeds up. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </span></p>
