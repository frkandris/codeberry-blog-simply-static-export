										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2021 promises the lack of employees in the IT world will grow to its doubles. Let’s check, which field requires more supply and <strong>how much can we make this year as a programmer?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our </span><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/how-much-can-you-make-as-a-programmer/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Salary Guide for 2020’ article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we already collected the stats about the average salaries in different fields of IT.

<h6><span style="font-weight: 400;">Source: </span><a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glassdoor</span></a></h6>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see, salaries for programmers are substantially high on the global average. However, with an increasingly virtual workplace, you’ll likely be able to have access to some of these jobs by working remotely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on your skillset and your position, your salary in the global market can vary between an <strong>average of $50,000 and $112,000 per year. </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like we’ve mentioned in earlier articles, many of the world’s largest tech companies are based in the USA, especially in expensive areas such as San Francisco. For this reason, we see that salaries for entry-level programming positions in the United States raise the global average. However, don’t get the idea that you won’t make much money because you aren’t in the United States.</span></p>
<h3>Starting Salary</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you first start learning to code, you’ll probably start with languages such as <strong>HTML, CSS,</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong>, which <strong>help you become a front-end developer or designer.</strong> These are entry-level positions that will give you the expertise and skills you need to continue in your career. The global <strong>average salary for a front-end developer is $77,000</strong> and the average for a designer is $58,000. </span></p>
<p><div class='et-box et-shadow'>
					<div class='et-box-content'>If you’re not aware of the difference between front-end and back-end development, check out our <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/a-brief-introduction-to-web-development/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Introduction to Web Development.</a> </div></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have mastered the basics of front-end development, you should <strong>consider looking at jobs in back-end development</strong>. Working in this position will earn you an <strong>average salary of $101,000</strong> globally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is a nice salary for a developer, and it also provides you with the opportunity to continue rising through the ranks and getting the highest paid jobs. </span></p>
<h3>Highest Paying Jobs</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the forecasts, some fields this year will get more attention than before. For example:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>1, Data Science:</strong> this field has a strong presence in almost every tech-related industry, which has something to do with business intelligence, self-driving vehicles but Data Science even applied in the defence against the Covid-19.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>2, Cyber Security:</strong> The more companies changed to remote working, the more the number of cyber-attacks increased. This is the reason why cybersecurity specialists became one of the most important IT-related occupations, and the employees in this field can expect an average 15% rise in their wages.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11934" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/most-popular-programming-languages.png" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/most-popular-programming-languages.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/most-popular-programming-languages-300x225.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/most-popular-programming-languages-768x576.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>3, Cloud Architect:</strong> Cloud technology is more popular year by year, and 2021 won’t be an exception either. </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">As cloud architecture is not a common occupation yet, you can reach a nice salary in a relatively short time and with less experience than other developers on the labour market. The most used tools of you will be the <strong>AS, Microsoft Azure</strong> or the <strong>Google Cloud</strong> &#8211; they are all perfect choices if you’d like to start to expand your knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The<strong> growing demand for artificial intelligence</strong> and our ever-increasing reliance on technology continues to create plenty of high-paying opportunities for programmers. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-11936 alignright" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-paid-programming-languages-683x1024.png" alt="" width="324" height="486" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-paid-programming-languages-683x1024.png 683w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-paid-programming-languages-200x300.png 200w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-paid-programming-languages-768x1152.png 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-paid-programming-languages.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 324px) 100vw, 324px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>DevOps and machine learning are growing trends in the software industry</strong> today. Associated languages and frameworks are on the rise and software developers working in these areas command the highest salaries.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">High-level programming languages rule in 2021</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It isn’t surprising at all, that </span><b>Java, JavaScript</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>Python </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">are still the most popular programming languages &#8211; but this year there is a chance for some newcomers to get more attention.</span> <b>Go is </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">the self-developed programming language of Google, </span><b>mostly used for Android development.</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">There is also a significant need for specialists who are familiar with </span><b>React </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><b>Angular</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Learning to Program Is a Good Investment</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Programming is one of the few professions that allows you to earn a six-figure salary, regardless of your level of education.</strong> Careers with similar salaries, such as engineering, medicine, and law, require you to spend incredible amounts of time and money to achieve the same results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Programming, on the other hand, allows you to reach the same level of financial success in just a fraction of the time. As long as you have the skills and the knowledge to get your job done, you won’t need to go into debt and attend a university for 4 years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, <strong>you’ll be able to teach yourself online</strong> and learn through a variety of methods which we’ll discuss in our </span><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/how-to-learn-to-code/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">”How to Learn How to Code”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> article. This is great news for those of us who didn’t have the opportunity to pursue higher education. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe that learning to code makes a positive impact on the world and allows the disadvantaged to make a modest living. In many countries where the minimum wage is below the poverty line, remote programming jobs give people opportunities that wouldn’t otherwise exist in their country.  </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How Much Will YOU Make?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How much you will make as a programmer<strong> can depend on </strong>a number of factors: <strong>your skill level, years of experience, and location.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to the internet and the ever-increasing popularity of remote work, your location is less of a factor than ever. Even if the average salary in your country may be rather low,<strong> working remotely gives you access to a global marketplace</strong> that values your skills and abilities over your geographical location. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll also want to learn <strong>how to market yourself well,</strong> whether you’re working as a freelancer or for a traditional company. Marketing yourself and <strong>creating a personal brand is especially important</strong> if you’re a freelancer and you are constantly dealing with short-term contracts and multiple clients to find work. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Additional Benefits of Learning How to Code</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, it’s pretty clear that learning how to write code will help you have high salaries. Are there any other benefits of learning this valuable skill? As it turns out, there are. Learning programming can help you in your personal development—not just in your career. </span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critical Thinking</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning to program will teach you about <strong>mathematics, logic, and critical thinking</strong> as you progress. Programming introduces you to topics such as boolean logic, variables, “if” statements, and other concepts <strong>that will improve your ability to think and construct logical arguments. </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, we know that you might be thinking, “I’ve never been good at math in my entire life.” That’s perfectly okay; most developers aren’t that great at math either.<strong> The more you learn and practice programming, the easier it will be to understand the overarching concepts.</strong> Don’t beat yourself up if you aren’t able to get it all on the first try; you’re still on time to catch up. </span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personal Projects</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most fun part about learning to code is the <strong>ability to create your own websites, games, programs, and mobile applications.</strong> Perhaps, you’ve always dreamed of having your own custom website for your portfolio, an app to keep you organized throughout the day, or your ideal videogame. All of these dreams can become a reality with programming. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe, you’ve considered creating a digital product or online service to start your own business and become an independent entrepreneur? In that case, you’ll definitely want to learn how to code to save yourself some money (now that you know how much programmers make). Being able to code will also<strong> give you complete freedom</strong> to create what you want. The only limit is your imagination and your time. </span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Future-proof Yourself </span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world is changing quickly and you definitely don’t want to be left behind. Even basic knowledge and understanding of code will help you to future-proof yourself and ensure that you don’t become obsolete in a technological landscape. It’s not just about getting a job either; <strong>learning to program will help you keep up with the modern world. </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business reports and projections continue to show that <strong>programming will only become more relevant</strong> in the coming years. That’s why it’s best to start learning as soon as you can. </span></p>
