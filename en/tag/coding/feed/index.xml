										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nowadays, we don’t use the internet just for getting information, reading, watching videos and movies, or listening to music—we also shape the content by using social media, posting, commenting, chatting, using web applications, shopping in online stores, planning routes, and so on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Complex development teams work together to operate the many functions above—different members are responsible for different areas, and they are using various technologies and programming languages to achieve this. At a well-chosen web development course, you can learn all the know-how of this segment.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12017 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main areas of web development</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Web development is usually separated into two big areas (front-end and back-end),</strong> and there’s another term for people who have <strong>comprehensive knowledge of both areas (full stack).</strong> In this article, we collected courses that can help you learn about these areas of web development and acquire the skills necessary to work in these fields.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Front-end</span></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/326514/pexels-photo-326514.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;dpr=2&amp;h=750&amp;w=1260" alt="web development courses" width="503" height="336" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the areas of web development is front-end development, i.e., the <strong>creation and maintenance of interfaces seen by the user.</strong> Client-side programming means creating and maintaining dynamic and responsive websites using plans from graphic artists and designers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a front-end developer, <strong>you have to be familiar with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</strong> In addition, it is also useful to know <strong>frameworks and libraries like Angular, jQuery, or React.</strong></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back-end</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another web development area we usually talk about separately is back-end development which means <strong>server-side programming and maintenance</strong>. Back-end developers create background processes and build communication with databases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some often-used server-side programming languages:<strong> Java, PHP, SQL, Python, Ruby, Node.js, ASP.NET. </strong></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full-stack</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are <strong>IT specialists that are familiar with both back-end and front-end development</strong>, i.e., they understand the whole web development process. Both background processes and the maintenance of user interfaces require complex knowledge, therefore front-end, back-end, and full-stack developers are all sought-after on the labour market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can read more about </span><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/introduction-to-web-development/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the basics of web development</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if you need more information.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web development courses</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are interested in this area and would like to work as a web developer, <strong>you should apply to a course</strong> you like and start learning web languages. The courses listed in this post have different goals, so they teach different technologies. In time, it will become important to make clear what you want to do so that you can learn things accordingly.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. </span><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/hu/weboldal-keszites-tanfolyam/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CodeBerry &#8211; Website Creation Course </span></a><i></i></h3>
<ul>
<li><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">19.990 Ft/month</span></i></li>

<li><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online, with mentorship</span></i></li>
<li><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">From beginner level</span></i></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can learn the<strong> basics of HTML, CSS3,</strong> and the use of online and offline editors during the course. After successfully completing it, you will be able to create modern websites by yourself. The course is online, and <strong>experienced mentors help you</strong> along the way if you get stuck. You can learn individually, and according to your schedule. <strong>No prior knowledge is required</strong>—just your interest and commitment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you already have some basic knowledge, we also recommend our </span><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/hu/weboldal-keszites-gyakorlofeladatok-tanfolyam/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Website Creation Practice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> course where you can strengthen your knowledge so that you can create websites more confidently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <strong>The course takes up 5 hours of your time per week,</strong> and you can create exciting new interfaces, e.g., the main page of a blog or the user interface of a chat app. You will get constant feedback on your work from the mentors so that your development becomes even faster.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I always wanted to know how I can create a great website since I had blogs, personal websites, journals, yet I could never make them my own through formatting. I had minimal HTML knowledge when I started the Website Creation module, and it is incredible how much I learned from it even on the first day. I am grateful for the opportunity to access these fantastic lessons anytime, anywhere, with completely understandable materials at a reasonable price.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” &#8211; Attila Szabó (Facebook)</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Coursera provides you:</span></i></p>
<ul>
<li><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several course options</span></i></li>
<li><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specialization possibilities</span></i></li>
<li><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">From beginner to advanced use</span></i></li>
<li><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Free to audit</span></i></li>
<li><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certificate options</span></i></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Coursera there are<strong> plenty of useful courses on different levels, durations and languages,</strong> you can filter them by every important segment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides <strong>beginner, intermediate and advanced</strong> levels there are also <strong>mixed courses</strong> – this last one is for those who already have a basic programming background and now the goal is to broaden their knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You also can choose from <strong>complete courses</strong> or just <strong>specializations</strong> depending on your goals and preferences.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like Coursera, Edx also collects several courses of programming, where you can find the perfect fit for your study level and for your demands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At EDx you can select from <strong>courses or complete programs,</strong> the last ones are mostly provided by Universities so you can take official undergraduate courses and get certificates from Harvard, UCLA or NYU, which looks really good on your resume. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>LinkedIn has a learning platform</strong> as well, which is known also as Lynda.com.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides <strong>detached programming courses,</strong> Lynda.com offers <strong>complete learning paths.</strong> If you’d like to start studying and have long-term plans to improve your skills, but some extra guidelines would be helpful, you can choose this option. In this case, you don’t have to worry about creating learning plans and search fitting courses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have already found your favourite course, <strong>you have the opportunity to follow all of the content provided by the same author.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also <strong>search for applied software</strong> which is really useful if you need to learn fast about a new framework or technique which is needed for your next project.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Pluralsight you also have the option to choose from <strong>complete learning paths,</strong> which generally <strong>contains 6-9 courses</strong> in order to get f<strong>rom a beginner level to intermediate or advanced.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your goal is just to get familiar with web development tools first, you can choose a <strong>single beginner course</strong>, but there are also <strong>specializations</strong> which are useful if you already code and need some extra knowledge for a project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pluralsight has a <strong>monthly fee to use,</strong> but there are other options as well, like <strong>annual billing and premium access,</strong> which provides you with more <strong>interactive content and extended materials.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pluralsight has also a Twitter channel where you can get feedback from the students about the course quality:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SkillShare provides a<strong> wide range of courses</strong> not just from the field of IT but also about filming, photography, marketing or soft skills as productivity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can<strong> filter by whole topics</strong> like web development, but in every search result, you’ll find <strong>further tags which separate the courses</strong> into smaller groups, so you don’t have to scroll down for hours, just pick the right tag and see the courses you’re interested in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’d like to give a try, SkillShare gives you <strong>unlimited free access for the first 7 days,</strong> and if you like their materials, you have the chance to upgrade your account for a monthly fee.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is worth checking the course list regularly, in order to find the ideal materials discounted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this option, most courses start from a very pleasant <strong>13.99 € price,</strong> and contain <strong>online or live-performed educational materials</strong> – but if you‘re unlucky, you could find 2-300€ course prices.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, programming skills are in high demand. According to the CNBC article, “<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/22/glassdoor-the-20-best-jobs-in-america-in-2019.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">The 20 Best Jobs in America in 2019</a>”, Software Engineering is the 10th best job with a median base pay of $104,000 per year. In addition, this list includes a number of other jobs in which programming skills would be extremely beneficial, if not a specific requirement. The top job specified is Data Engineer. It’s perfectly reasonable to expect that programming skills would go a long way in helping you land a role in this field. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we’re going to go over some of the many reasons why you should </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">learn programming</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and how it could change your life. This could be through obtaining a new career or simply building some cool stuff to show off to your friends. We’re going to talk about money and the ways in which coding skills can be applied in various different areas. We’re also going to talk about how gaining these competencies can actually help you develop as a person in an increasingly digital world.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12017 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3><b>Money</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s an unavoidable fact: salaries are super important. Most people want to know that any time investment they make into learning new skills will pay off in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned above, some of the most sought-after skills in today’s world are programming related. From simple scripting to building software that will push the boundaries of science as we know it &#8211; see Katie Bouman’s amazing black-hole imaging program &#8211; technology is becoming increasingly intrinsic to the very fabric of society. And code is what drives it all. So, it may not come as a surprise that companies will pay a ton of money to get great developers into their teams.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some stats about software salaries to get you excited about your future prospects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to payscale.com, entry-level software engineers get paid these salaries in the following US cities:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York, New York &#8211; $96,200 per year.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco, California &#8211; $112,368 per year.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Austin, Texas &#8211; $79,154 per year.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Remember:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It’s important to do your own research before making any decisions.</span></p>
<h3><b>Control Your Own Destiny</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contrary to popular belief, you don’t need a degree in Computer Science to be a programmer.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> There are very few requirements for getting started; just a computer and an internet connection. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With these two things, you can start learning and taking online courses in no time.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Additionally, there are many free programming resources that come with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">practice problems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This opens up a number of possibilities for the budding programmer. While salaried </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">software development</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> jobs are sometimes better in terms of money, job security and benefits, there are many other avenues available with their own unique appeal. I’ll talk about some of these below.</span></p>
<h4><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freelancing</span></i></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’d like to work for yourself, choose your own clients and even decide when to get out of bed, this might be for you. There are various services on the web which help with this lifestyle, such as Upwork, Codementor, and Freelancer. If you don’t want to use one of these sites, you could court your own clients and build relationships and connections within the industry. A lot of big tech companies started this way &#8211; with just a couple of people working for themselves to build their dream.</span></p>
<h4><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start your own online business</span></i></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have no interest in becoming a software engineer by trade? So what! You can still leverage your programming skills to build your own business, whether that be in e-commerce, private consultancy, construction or… anything really!</span></p>
<h3><b>Develop New Skills</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning to code is more than just </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">learning to code. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s actually learning to think analytically, break down problems, design solutions and loads of other things. For example, if you’re working with others on a project, you’ll learn collaborative skills. If you’re building a complex piece of software or a computer program that you want to ship to others, you’ll learn communication skills, because you need to make sure you document it as well as possible. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12028 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning to code isn’t just about putting words on a screen in a specific order; it’s about transforming the way you think about things. And those kinds of competencies are valuable in any area of modern life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t learn popular programming languages because everyone else is doing it. Choose what you want to learn! </span></p>
<h3><b>Limitless Possibilities</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning to code opens up a world of exciting possibilities, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">whether you decide to learn web development, game development, or Android development</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve learned the basics, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">you can build video games, websites, desktop applications, and mobile apps. You can create scrapers that trawl through web content and gather data. You can build visualization software, which can take large amounts of inaccessible information and present it in a clear manner. Want to build an evil Artificial Intelligence </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">equipped with machine learning</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, enslave humanity and eventually take over the known universe? Why not? You can do that too (maybe).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another fun and creative thing that’s possible with coding skills is generative art. This is the art that is created by drawing pixels onto the screen based on </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">some kind of algorithm.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I came across a website not too long ago that takes three values—day, month &amp; year—and uses them in a mathematical equation to generate an image. You can see an example of this </span><a href="https://www.johndcook.com/expsum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Cool, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also contribute to open-source projects. This is software that’s built under a special license and available for free use in any other software. It’s often a team effort, and a great way to make friends and be a part of something much bigger than just yourself. There are loads of projects out there right now waiting for your input.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are some great examples of things you can do with code, but truthfully, they barely even scratch the surface. The only way you can begin to explore the countless possibilities is to put your hands to the keyboard and get started.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12019 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3><b>Conclusion</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve looked at a few reasons why you should learn programming. We’ve talked about the salary prospects, the ability to control your own destiny, its benefits in helping to develop other skills and all the cool and creative possibilities it brings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, it’s becoming more essential to our very lives each and every day. We live in a digital world, and this is only going to become truer as time progresses. If you start developing these skills now, you can try to ride the wave rather than be helplessly carried along with it. The resources are out there and you can start today.</span></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you’ve decided that you want to learn how to code, it’s time to turn your dream into reality.</span></p>
<h4>In this article, we’ll take a look at:</h4>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which coding languages are best for beginners </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Educational resources available to you </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">First steps towards learning programming </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to become a programmer </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’d also like to point you in the direction of some supplementary resources that will help you to continue to learn on your own, such as video tutorials, podcasts, apps, games, and more. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://pixabay.com/photos/laptop-woman-education-study-young-3087585/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7962" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/laptop-3087585_1280.jpg" alt="It’s always exciting to learn how to code" width="1280" height="853" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/laptop-3087585_1280.jpg 1280w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/laptop-3087585_1280-300x200.jpg 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/laptop-3087585_1280-1024x682.jpg 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/laptop-3087585_1280-768x512.jpg 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/laptop-3087585_1280-1080x720.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, let’s start with the most important skills that you’ll need to succeed as a coder: </span></p>
<h3>Good Programming Languages for Beginners</h3>
<h4><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/beginners-guide-to-python-programming-language/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Python</span></em></a></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Python is a powerful, high-level programming language that can be used for a wide variety of purposes such as creating desktop applications, developing web apps, and even solving mathematical equations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you hear the term “high-level programming language,” you might get the idea that it’s more difficult to learn or more complex than others. However, the term “high-level” simply refers to the fact that the language is more developed and that it’s closer to a human language. A high-level language saves you time and frustration by allowing you to write in a more natural manner. Writing in a low-level language may require you to constantly repeat yourself and type out the obvious. Python doesn’t generally do that. Instead, it allows you to create highly readable and maintainable code, which is one of the most important aspects of programming. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting with Python is one of the best ways for beginners to quickly learn the basics of programming and to create a basis for future learning. Thanks to a high number of applications and an easy-to-use syntax, Python is a great language, to begin with as you embark upon your coding journey.</span></p>
<h4><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/beginners-guide-to-javascript/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">JavaScript</span></em></a></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JavaScript is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> programming language that powers the web and makes pages interactive and functional.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re interested in developing websites, JavaScript is an indispensable tool. While it’s true that HTML and CSS handle the organizational and visual aspects of your website, it’s JavaScript that brings everything to life. You’ll be able to create “scripts” that cause the website to react in a certain way when you click on a button, enter information into a form, and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to its popularity, there are plenty of resources available for learning JavaScript online, such as coding bootcamps and university courses. JavaScript is also incredibly versatile, as it can either be used in the front end or in the back end with the use of a run-time environment like Node.js.</span></p>
<h4><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/beginners-guide-to-java-programming-language/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Java</span></em></a></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to being one of the most popular programming languages in the world, Java (not to be confused with JavaScript) is extremely versatile and can be used in a wide variety of applications. And if you decide to learn Java, there’s a good chance of landing a job at a large corporation. Java, along with JavaScript and Python, is used by tech giants like Google, Facebook, and many more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you learn Java, you will open up a whole new world of possibilities in your career as a software engineer. Using Java, you’ll be able to write computer programs for a huge variety of devices, such as smartphones, ATMs, TVs, computers, and more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Java, you can also become a mobile developer for Android. Although iOS development was the trend in recent years (iOS uses Swift), creating apps for Android devices has become more commonplace. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to its popularity, there is an abundance of resources for learning Java, both online and in the real world.</span></p>

<h3>Educational Programs</h3>
<h4><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coding Bootcamps </span></em></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we briefly mentioned in our “<a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/a-brief-introduction-to-programming/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Introduction to Web Development</a>” article, coding bootcamps are short and condensed learning programs that function like military bootcamps. You probably won’t be running through tires and scrubbing the toilet with your toothbrush, but you’ll definitely be pushed to your mental limits with one of these intensive courses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coding bootcamps generally last about 14 weeks (3-4 months) and teach you the fundamental skills that you need to succeed in a specific role, such as full-stack developer or frontend developer. Many employers often search for up-and-coming developers at the end of the program and choose from the best talent among the group. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If one could truly learn everything there is to know about programming in 14 weeks, no one would pursue a degree in Computer Science or spend years developing their skills. Coding bootcamps, however, teach you the skills you need for entry-level programming jobs that don’t necessarily require a CS degree. When you’re just starting out and are looking for your first programming job, a coding bootcamp could be a great fit for you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coding bootcamps are also a great option for those who want a quick overview of coding and need to learn the basics as soon as possible. To continue learning, however, we recommend that you supplement your education with more courses, additional reading materials, and daily practice. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12017 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h4><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">University Courses</span></em></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Undoubtedly the most traditional form of education, a university program will provide you with a great overview of Computer Science and will help you to understand the underlying concepts behind the code. However, don’t expect your professors to hold your hand and teach you how to code in Python, JavaScript, or C++. Universities do offer courses that teach you the basics of each language, but you’ll spend more of your time learning very complex mathematics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For jobs in research, or at high-profile companies like Google, you’ll want to complete a Computer Science degree. However, if your dream job is to work at a medium-sized company or game studio, there’s a good chance that you won’t need to attend a University. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a university course, you’ll learn ideas, concepts, and theories, but very few skills that you can use immediately upon graduation. It’s up to you to learn various programming languages and search out the resources you need to succeed. This may be a disappointing reality for some when they graduate with a degree in Computer Science and leave the university lacking a sense of accomplishment. Regardless, being self-motivated and seeking out new knowledge on your own is a key characteristic of successful coders. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is why we recommend that both graduates and those currently enrolled in a Computer Science program learn to code on their own time. Online courses, coding bootcamps, and supplemental resources will all help you become a programming pro. </span></p>
<h4><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online Courses </span></em></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online courses combine the best of traditional education with the skill-focused philosophy of a coding bootcamp. Not only will you learn the overarching concepts and theories behind programming, but you’ll also learn the skills you need to get a job. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The freedom to study where, when, and how you want provides online learners with the flexibility that isn’t available to traditional students. You won’t need to quit your job, move to a new city, and pay thousands of dollars in tuition to learn valuable skills. Instead, you’ll be able to develop professionally in the comfort of your own home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online courses also come at a fraction of the cost of a university program. An online class generally provides you with the resources you need in a digital format and, unlike a course at your local university, you probably won’t have to spend anything on old, outdated textbooks. Instead, you’ll have access to a specialized curriculum that is written by industry professionals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For English speakers, there are a variety of courses available online, such as Codecademy. Codecademy is a free resource that teaches you the basics of a variety of different programming languages. However, if you want to choose a specific career path, such as web development, data science, or computer science, you’ll have to sign up for the pro (paid) version. The pro version also gives you access to more advanced material. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">CodeBerry</a>, you’ll find in-depth courses that are specialized for specific career paths, such as sitebuilder or front-end developer. In addition to teaching you programming in your own language, CodeBerry also assigns you a coding mentor, pairs you up with a learning buddy, and gives you access to a friendly online community.   </span></p>
<h3>Supplemental Resources:</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although only 20% of the world’s population speaks English, it’s estimated that over 55% of the internet is written in English. This means that the majority of resources you find online won’t be written in your native language. Therefore, the availability of the following resources will vary depending on your native language. </span></p>
<h4><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watch Videos </span></em></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve learned a lot of important skills over the years by simply watching YouTube videos. YouTube is a great free resource that contains videos and channels dedicated to nearly every topic imaginable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are plenty of great videos from real web developers and programmers who share their personal experiences and give you “insider knowledge” on what you need to know. YouTube also contains many interviews with coders who give their thoughts on finding a job and how they reached professional success. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a great supplement to your core learning, YouTube videos aren’t consistent enough in quality to provide you with a solid education. You’ll also discover many gaps in your knowledge and have trouble finding resources to answer all of the questions that you may have regarding in-depth topics.  </span></p>
<h4><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online Communities</span></em></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joining online forums and groups will help you connect with fellow coders that may be able to guide you in the right direction and provide you with helpful advice for your career. Learning from the experience of others can also help you avoid the same mistakes that they have made and find a smoother path towards success. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you realize it or not, becoming part of a community is also important for developing your confidence and building your identity as a “real” coder. Through interaction with others, you’ll leave behind the imposter syndrome that appears after learning new skills and beginning a new career. As you search for that first job or your dream job, a community will provide you with the support and stability you need to move forward.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By chance, you might even find job openings and opportunities through online communities, as employers often browse the web to find talented programmers. You can also network with fellow programmers and work on projects together, reinforcing that sense of belonging to a community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can often be difficult to find online communities in your own language for coding and programming-related topics. Fortunately, CodeBerry gives you access to an online community with fellow students who speak your language and learn alongside you. </span></p>
<h4><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find a Coding Mentor</span></em></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most valuable resources you can have as a learner isn’t a resource at all, but rather a person. Since they have already gone through the same process, mentors are like gold mines of tips, tricks, and experience. Think of your mentor as your future self who can help you arrive at your goals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll learn from their mistakes and make sense of your own as you talk with your mentor and discuss your progress. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mentors can also help you after graduation by giving you advice on how to find jobs, grow your portfolio, and what to expect in an interview. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12028 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you personally know a programmer or developer, ask them if you can become their apprentice and help them with their daily work. Tasks that might be easy and mundane for a professional could be a great learning experience for you. This way, you’ll gain invaluable insights and experience while providing them with value in exchange for their help.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few websites that can help you find mentors online, such as codementor.io. On Codementor, you’ll be able to find experienced programmers and developers who can give you the guidance you need—at a price. This can be quite costly, as mentors start at about $10 per 15 minutes of advising ($40/hr). We would recommend this option only if you don’t have any personal contacts with programmers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CodeBerry, on the other hand, provides you with a mentor to help you in your coding education journey. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our coding mentors are IT professionals with years of experience in their field. In addition to answering your questions via chat, our mentors help you craft your learning plan, review your code and give suggestions to enhance it, and keep you accountable and committed to your courses. </span></p>
<h4><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Listen to Podcasts</span></em></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The true beauty of podcasts is that they are free, educational, and allow you to learn on the go. When you feel the need to study while you’re stuck in rush hour traffic or commuting on the bus, you can pop in your earphones and listen to some great resources. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because coding is highly visual, audio might not be the best way to learn how to code. However, podcasts will keep you informed of recent updates to programming languages and related technologies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A great coding podcast for beginners is CodeNewbie which discusses the experiences of new coders and how they learned to code, how they landed their first job, etc. Other podcasts like Software Engineering Daily and Coding Blocks cover more technical topics and provide a lot of valuable knowledge for free. </span></p>
<h4><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Books/Resources</span></em></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s nearly impossible to memorize every command in a programming language. Books and other online resources such as W3 Schools provide you with documentation to reference when you need a quick hint or reminder. If you prefer print over digital, there are plenty of great books available on websites like Amazon that provide you with a handy guide to programming languages. For the rest of us, W3 Schools has free guides on their website that will help you as you learn to code.  </span></p>

<h4><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coding Games &amp; Apps </span></em></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to learn how to code and have fun at the same time, coding games and apps are perfect for you. You’ll have so much fun playing these interactive, educational games that you’ll forget that you’re actually learning. Oftentimes, reading books and documents on code can be dry, boring, and a great way to cure sleeplessness. On the other hand, games and apps will keep you interested and engaged, creating the perfect environment for learning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Games such as CodeCombat and CodinGame are extremely fun and help you continue to learn when you feel like your brain is fried after a traditional study session. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://codecombat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">CodeCombat</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a browser-based RPG that allows you to control your character with lines of code. Through this method, you’ll learn languages such as JavaScript and Python without even realizing it. Not to mention, it’s a complete blast to play.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With various lines of code, you’ll make your hero move, attack, and perform certain actions that help you complete each level. As you progress through the levels, you’ll learn important programming concepts such as syntax, arguments, strings, and more. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.codingame.com/start" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">CodinGame</a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is another website that features a wide variety of games that will help you improve your coding skills. CodinGame is much more difficult than CodeCombat and is geared towards those who already have a basic understanding of programming languages. If you are completely new to coding, you might want to try simpler games, such as CodeCombat, first. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personally, it took me a while to just navigate the site and figure out what I should have been doing. After I got adjusted to the layout, I was happily coding away in Python to control my spaceship and fire lasers at alien enemies; it felt pretty good. </span></p>
<h3>Practice &amp; Good Study Habits</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a wise man once said, “Practice makes perfect.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter how many books you read, videos you watch, or the classes you attend, you’ll have to write code frequently to solidify your knowledge. Find projects to work on and create personal goals that cause you to always test your limits and learn new skills. Over time, you’ll find yourself prepared to start your first job. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll also want to have the drive and initiative to teach yourself the skills that you need to know. Self-taught learners tend to make the best programmers since technologies and languages are always changing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In many careers, it’s possible to become an expert in a given topic and feel like you can sit back, relax, and quit growing. As a programmer, you don’t have the luxury of letting your guard down and ceasing to learn new things. The moment that you stop learning is the moment when your knowledge starts to become outdated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team at CodeBerry would like to encourage you to be a lifelong learner and to continuously seek to improve your coding skills. If you’re interested in learning to code in your own language, being paired up with a mentor, and want access to a friendly online community, visit our website and <a href="https://orange.codeberryschool.com/auth/signup" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">sign up to take our first 25 assignments for free. </a></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you need more tricks or advices, check out the following articles too &#8211; in these we are writing about our own experiences and ideas that might can help you to get really good chances at a job interview or earn some more additional skills to improve your programming knowledge!</p>
<ul>
<li class="entry-title"><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/interview-tips-that-will-give-you-confidence-and-help-you-land-a-dev-job/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Interview tips that will give you confidence and help you land a dev job</a></li>

</ul>
<h3><b>Before you learn to code, think about what you want to code</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing how to code is mostly about building things, and the path is a lot clearer when you have a sense of the end goal. If your goal is “learn to code,” without a clear idea of the kinds of programs you will write and how they will make your life better, you will probably find it a frustrating exercise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m a little ashamed to admit that part of my motivation for studying computer science was that I wanted to prove I was smart, and I wanted to be able to get Smart Person jobs. I also liked thinking about math and theory (</span><a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Godel-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this book</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> blew my mind at an impressionable age) and the program was a good fit. It wasn’t enough to sustain me for long, though, until I found ways to connect technology to the things I really loved, like music and literature.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what do you want to code? Websites? Games? iPhone apps? A startup that makes you rich? Interactive art? Do you want to be able to impress your boss or automate a tedious task so you can spend more time looking at otter pictures? Perhaps you simply want to be more employable, add a buzzword to your resume, or fulfill the requirements of your educational program. All of these are worthy goals. Make sure you know which one is yours, and study accordingly.</span></p>
<h3><b>There’s nothing mystical about it</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coding is a skill like any other. Like language learning, there’s grammar and vocabulary to acquire. Like math, there are processes to work through specific types of problems. Like all kinds of craftsmanship and art-making, there are techniques and tools and best practices that people have developed over time, specialized to different tasks, that you’re free to use or modify or discard.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/ThePerilsofJavaSchools.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This guy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (a very smart guy! Whose other writings I enjoy and frequently agree with!) posits that there is a bright line between people with the True Mind of a Programmer and everyone else, who are lacking the intellectual capacity needed to succeed in the field. That bright line consists, according to him, of pointers and recursion (there are primers </span><a href="http://alumni.cs.ucr.edu/~pdiloren/C++_Pointers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://inventwithpython.com/blog/2011/08/11/recursion-explained-with-the-flood-fill-algorithm-and-zombies-and-cats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the curious).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I learned about pointers and recursion in school, and when I understood them, it was a delightful jolt to my brain — the kind of intellectual pleasure that made me want to study computer science in the first place. But, outside of classroom exercises, the number of times I’ve had to be familiar with either concept to get things done has been relatively small. And when helping others learn, over and over again, I’ve watched people complete interesting and rewarding projects without knowing anything about either one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no point in being intimidated or wondering if you’re Smart Enough. Sure, the more complex and esoteric your task, the higher the level of mastery you will need to complete it. But this is true in absolutely every other field. Unless you’re planning to make your living entirely by your code, chances are you don’t have to be a recursion-understanding genius to make the thing you want to make.</span></p>
<h3><b>It never works the first time</b></h3>
<h4><b>And probably won’t the second or third time</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you first start learning to code, you’ll very quickly run up against this particular experience: you think you’ve set up everything the way you’re supposed to, you’ve checked and re-checked it, and it still. doesn’t. work. You don’t have a clue where to begin trying to fix it, and the error message (if you’re lucky enough to have one at all) might as well say “fuck you.” You might be tempted to give up at this point, thinking that you’ll never figure it out, that you’re not cut out for this. I had that feeling the first time I tried to write a program in C++, ran it, and got only the words “segmentation fault” for my trouble.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this experience is so common for programmers of all skill levels that it says absolutely nothing about your intelligence, tech-savviness, or suitability for the coding life. It will happen to you as a beginner, but it will also happen to you as an experienced programmer. The main difference will be in how you respond to it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve found that a big difference between new coders and experienced coders is faith: faith that things are going wrong for a logical and discoverable reason, faith that problems are fixable, faith that there is a way to accomplish the goal. The path from “not working” to “working” might not be obvious, but with patience you can usually find it.</span></p>
<h3><b>Someone will always tell you you’re doing it wrong</b></h3>
<p><a href="http://theprofoundprogrammer.com/page/17" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Braces should go on the next line</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/2782" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Braces should go on the same line</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="http://derkarl.org/why_to_tabs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use tabs to indent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TabsAreEvil" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But tabs are evil</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You should </span><a href="http://mysqlstoredprocedure.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=51&amp;Itemid=40" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">use stored procedures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but actually </span><a href="http://www.tonymarston.co.uk/php-mysql/stored-procedures-are-evil.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you shouldn’t use them</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You should </span><a href="http://www.lanoie.net/classes/DHTML/programming/lectures/lecture.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">always comment your code</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But </span><a href="http://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2013/06/01/roc-rocks.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">good code doesn’t need comments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are almost always many different approaches to a particular problem, with no single “right way.” A lot of programmers get very good at advocating for their preferred way, but that doesn’t mean it’s the One True Path. Going head-to-head with people telling me I was Wrong, and trying to figure out if they were right, was one of the more stressful aspects of my early career.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re coding in a team with other people, someone will almost certainly take issue with something that you’re doing. Sometimes they’ll be absolutely correct, and it’s always worth investigating to see whether you are, in fact, Doing It Wrong. But sometimes they will be full of shit or re-enacting an ancient and meaningless dispute where it would be best to just follow a style guide and forget about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, if you’re the kind of person who enjoys ancient but meaningless disputes (grammar nerds, I’m looking at you), you’ve come to the right place.</span></p>

<h3><b>Someone will always tell you you’re not a real coder</b></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/prog.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HTML isn’t real coding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="http://the-shaolin.blogspot.ca/2007/12/why-vi-only-true-programmers-editor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t use vi, you’re not really serious</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="http://www.ericsink.com/entries/c_morse_code.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real programmers know C</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="http://www.zazzle.ca/real_coders_dont_do_windows_tees-235789605999466863" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real coders don’t do Windows.</span></a> <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/07/separating-programming-sheep-from-non-programming-goats.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some people will never be able to learn it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/05/please-dont-learn-to-code.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You shouldn’t learn to code</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2013/08/21/chase-felker-youre-not-a-computer-programmer-and-thats-ok/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re not a computer programmer (but I am)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Coding” means a lot of different things to a lot of different people, and it looks different now from how it used to. And, funnily enough, the tools and packages and frameworks that make it faster and easier for newcomers or even trained developers to build things are most likely to be tarred with the “not for REAL coders” brush. (See: “</span><a href="http://blog.enfranchisedmind.com/2009/04/return-of-the-real-programmer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Return of the Real Programmer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">”)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behind all this is the fear that </span><a href="http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2013/08/21/chase-felker-youre-not-a-computer-programmer-and-thats-ok/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">if “anyone” can call themselves a programmer, the title will become meaningless</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But I think that this gatekeeping is destructive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the tools that make it easiest to build the things you want to build. If that means your game was made in Stencyl or GameMaker rather than written from scratch, that’s fine. If your first foray into coding is HTML or Excel macros, that’s fine. Work with something you feel you can stick with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you get more comfortable, you’ll naturally start to find those tools limiting rather than helpful and look for more powerful ones. But most of the time, few people will ever even look at your code or even ask what you used — It’s what you make with it that counts.</span></p>
<h3><b>Worrying about “geek cred” will slowly kill you</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">See above. I used to worry a lot, especially in school, about whether I was identifying myself as “not a real geek” (and therefore less worthy of inclusion in tech communities) through my clothing, my presentation, my choice of reading material and even my software customization choices. It was a terrible waste of energy and I became a lot more functional after I made the decision to let it all go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to internalize this: your ability to get good at coding has </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">nothing</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to do with how well you fit into the various geek subcultures. This goes double if you know deep down that you’ll never quite fit. The energy you spend proving yourself should be going into making things instead. And, if you’re an indisputable geek with cred leaking from your eye sockets, keep this in mind for when you’re evaluating someone else’s cred level. It may not mean what you think it does.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-7777 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/business-3560932_1920-3.jpg" alt="With a few advice i'ts always easier to learn, how to code" width="1920" height="1280" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/business-3560932_1920-3.jpg 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/business-3560932_1920-3-300x200.jpg 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/business-3560932_1920-3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/business-3560932_1920-3-768x512.jpg 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/business-3560932_1920-3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/business-3560932_1920-3-1080x720.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<h3><b>Sticking with it is more important than the method</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no shortage of articles about the “right” or “best” way to learn how to code, and there are lots of potential approaches. You can learn the concepts </span><a href="http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">from a book</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or by </span><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">completing interactive exercises</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or by </span><a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/intro.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">debugging things that others have written</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And, of course, there are lots of languages you might choose as your first to learn, with advocates for each.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A common complaint with “teach yourself to code” programs and workshops is that you’ll breeze happily through the beginner material and then hit a steep curve where things get more difficult very quickly. You know how to print some lines of text on a page but have no idea where to start working on a “real,” useful project. You might feel like you were just following directions without really understanding and blame the learning materials.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12255 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you get to this stage, most of the tutorials and online resources available to you are much less useful because they assume you’re already an experienced and comfortable programmer. The difficulty is further compounded by the fact that “you don’t know what you don’t know.” Even trying to figure out what to learn next is a puzzle in itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll hit this wall no matter what “learn to code” program you follow, and the only way to get past it is to persevere. This means you keep trying new things, learning more information, and figuring out, piece by piece, how to build your project. You’re a lot more likely to find success in the end if you have a clear idea of why you’re learning to code in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you keep putting bricks on top of each other, it might take a long time but eventually, you’ll have a wall. This is where that faith I mentioned earlier comes in handy. If you believe that with time and patience you can figure the whole coding thing out, in time you almost certainly will. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

</ul>
<h3><b>What is programming?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose that you work for a multinational company and you have an upcoming meeting with a businessman from China. Your native language is [insert local language] and you don’t speak a word of Chinese. However, you remember that your second language is English and that the Chinese businessman speaks English as well. You then begin to use English as a common language to negotiate and communicate with each other. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12017 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3><b>What language do computers speak?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A computer’s native language is binary: an incredibly long list of 1’s and 0’s. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Binary</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> isn’t very easy for people to read or write, so we came up with programming languages to talk with computers, instead. Since computers don’t know human languages, we have to meet in the middle somewhere. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, unlike humans, computers aren’t able to pick up on indirect communication and always take things very literally. If you tell them something, they will do it exactly as they are told. Computers aren’t smart enough to make decisions on their own and won’t understand information that isn’t spelt out for them. For this reason, you need to make sure that you’re giving them exact instructions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if I told you to make a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sandwich</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you might ask me what ingredients I want on that sandwich and if I want it toasted or not. To you, that might be all you need to know to make me a delicious sandwich. However, there are many small decisions and previous knowledge involved in making a sandwich. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you simply tell a computer that you want a toasted ham and cheese sandwich with rye bread and mayonnaise, you might get something very different from what you ordered. A human would know that the mayonnaise goes on the slices of bread first, the ham and cheese are added second, then the sandwich is placed in the oven to be toasted. </span></p>
<h3><b>But, how is a computer supposed to know all</b> that?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember that we told the computer that we want, “a toasted ham and cheese sandwich with rye bread and mayonnaise.” To a computer, it might be logical to do all of those things in order. It would toast the ham and cheese by themselves, put two slices of rye bread on top, and then spread mayonnaise on the bread. </span></p>
<h3>Aren’t computers supposed to be smarter than that?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, because the computer takes things</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> literally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you have to specify the order of each step and the placement of each ingredient. Everyone knows that the ingredients go between the pieces of bread, but a computer has no previous knowledge of what a sandwich is like—it’s just following your direct instructions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is another reason why we can’t communicate with computers using human languages, just yet. Our languages are simply too ambiguous and too vague for a computer to understand properly. Also, if a word or a sentence might have a double meaning, a computer wouldn’t know how to interpret it. It needs everything spelt out for it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The truth is that computers aren’t smart at all; they just happen to process information faster than us. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6210" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/code.2-1.jpg" alt="" width="5472" height="3648" /></p>
<h3>What is a programmer and what do they do?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember, you can’t just tell the computer in English what you want. You’ll need a computer programmer to translate for you. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A computer programmer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a person who communicates your ideas and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">instructions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to a computer, making websites, games, and other programs appear on the screen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A programmer could also be defined as a polyglot (one who knows many languages) that specializes in talking to computers. They know exactly what to say and how to say it so that the computer will understand them. If you’ve ever learned another language, you know that each language comes with its own vocabulary, grammar, and set of rules. Computer languages also come with their own way of saying things, called syntax. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a person might understand you if you </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mispronounce</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a word, use the wrong conjugation, or mess up your grammar, a computer is a lot less forgiving with mistakes. As soon as you make a syntax error, the computer will stop listening to you and quit running the program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How rude. </span></p>
<h3>What are you able to accomplish with coding skills?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve ever used a computer, watched videos online, or played video games, it might be hard to believe that all of that comes from just a series of letters and symbols. The ability to process thousands of lines of code per second is the strength of a computer and allows it to follow highly complex instructions and accomplish incredible tasks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s take a look at some of the cool things you can do with code:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create &amp; Design Websites</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Build Mobile Apps</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Develop Desktop Programs</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Develop Video Games</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create &amp; Maintain Databases</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automate Tasks</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solve Complex Problems</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create Artificial Intelligence</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perform Statistical Analysis</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And much more&#8230;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re interested in any of these activities and would like to do them for a living, learning to program is definitely an important skill to have. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12028 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3>What makes coding useful and what is it good for?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we rely more and more on computers in our daily lives, the importance of computer programming and coding continues to grow as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the coming years, nearly all fields will involve computer programming and learning to code will give you an edge in your future career. For example, you can use programming skills in the areas of writing, analysis, management, engineering, software development, and so much more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advocates of programming see learning to code as a universal skill that everyone should have, such as the ability to read and write or perform simple mathematical equations. Many governments around the world believe this as well and have proposed initiatives to teach coding to kids alongside core curriculum in schools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like us, they see coding as the key to staying competitive in a global marketplace. </span></p>
<h3>I already know it’s useful, but what is programming actually like?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average day in the life of a programmer isn’t as glamorous as it might appear in movies or on television shows. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being a programmer requires a lot of concentration, patience, and a self-driven attitude. If you aren’t able to sit down and focus for hours at a time, you might want to reconsider pursuing a career in computer programming. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some programming jobs may require you to work on an irregular schedule and be available to fix bugs and solve problems immediately as they appear. Others may have you work from nine to five o’clock, just like a regular job. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, working as a computer programmer might give you more freedom than your current job allows. A good number of programming jobs are remote, meaning that you can code while at home, at a café, or while you get a tan at the beach—given that the wifi signal reaches that far. </span></p>
<h3>Is programming really right for me?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where the rubber meets the road and where you’ll have to seriously weigh the computer programmer pros and cons. Perhaps, you’ve had an unrealistic idea of what programming is like and haven’t considered that coding is just like any other job out there—it’s still hard work. However, if you meet the following criteria, chances are that you’ll love every second of it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Signs that Programming Isn’t Right for You:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are only motivated by money and aren’t interested in computers at all</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t like to sit down for long periods of time</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your eyes glaze over when you look at a page of code</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are relatively slow at typing and often make many typos</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Signs that Programming IS Right For You:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You describe yourself as both analytical AND creative</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have high attention to detail</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are comfortable working with others and working alone</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have a good basis for understanding written English</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You love problem-solving</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You love to always learn new things</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You adapt well to change</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You like to organize information and automate processes</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>What programming languages do I choose and where do I start?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s go back to the example of our meeting with the Chinese businessman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although English may be useful in a business setting, you might find that you need to learn other languages for different fields. For example, you might want to know French for diplomacy, Greek for philosophy, and German in the field of engineering. Depending on what field you work in, you will choose a specific language to meet your needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You won’t have the time or ability to learn every programming language out there, so you’ll need to be strategic about what languages you will learn. First, you need to determine what your focus is and what languages you need to know to accomplish your personal goals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While technically not programming languages, HTML and CSS are great languages to start with to begin learning the fundamentals of how programming works. HTML and CSS are “text markup languages” which are actually languages that we use to format and organize the text. Without HTML or CSS, your browser wouldn’t know if these words I’m writing are a headline, a paragraph, or a footer. It also wouldn’t know if these words should be bolded, italicized, etc. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even as I write this article, I am using HTML and CSS to help you and your internet browser understand what I have to say. </span></p>

<h3>TL;DR (Too Long; Didn’t Read)</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In summary, programming is a high-paying career that requires patience, dedication, and extremely high attention to detail. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you hate sitting down at a computer and aren’t willing to put in the time to practice, you’ll likely hate programming and give up rather quickly. You also won’t do well if you are motivated by the paycheck and have no interest in the job itself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if you love learning new things, are self-motivated, and have a can-do attitude, you’ll succeed—regardless of your educational background.</span></p>
