<h2>How Much Do Programmers Make?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our previous article, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“<a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/a-brief-introduction-to-programming/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Introduction to Programming</a>,”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we briefly discussed some of the incredible benefits of working as a coder, such as the ability to work from home, a more flexible schedule, higher pay, and access to more job opportunities—both locally and globally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, for most, the greatest motive for learning to program is the salary and the earning potential associated with this lucrative career. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we stated before in our previous article, money should not be your only source of motivation when choosing a job in programming. It’s important to maintain a realistic mindset and remember that being a developer is not unlike any other career. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There will be moments of joy and frustration, boredom and excitement, laziness and motivation, stress and relaxation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For this reason, it’s absolutely necessary that you develop a passion for programming and learn perseverance so that you will stick with it—even when things get rough. In addition to these two qualities, many factors will determine your continued success in this career.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, money is a compelling reason to work, so let’s take a look at what you can expect to earn as a programmer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To provide you with a general overview of computer programmer salaries, we’ll be using information from</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> global averages. While the national average salary in your country might be rather low, this information should still give you a good idea of what you can make by accessing the global market online.</span></p>
<h2>Average IT Salary</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below are the results from the 2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survey. In the survey, nearly 90.000 respondents answered a questionnaire regarding their job, salary, experience, and skillset. In the following graph, we are able to see the average IT salary by position: </span></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Source: <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survey</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see, salaries for programmers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are substantially high</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the global average. However, with an increasingly virtual workplace, you’ll likely be able to have access to some of these jobs by working remotely. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on your skillset and your position, your salary in the global market can vary between an average of $40,000 and $89,000 per year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like we’ve mentioned in earlier articles, many of the world’s largest tech companies are based in the USA, especially in expensive areas such as San Francisco. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For this reason, we see that salaries for entry-level programming positions in the United States raise the global average. However, don’t get the idea that you won’t make much money because you aren’t in the United States.</span></p>
<p><div style="width: 970px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://pixabay.com/hu/photos/munka-hivatal-csapat-v%C3%A1llalat-5382501/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large" src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2020/07/08/04/12/work-5382501_960_720.jpg" alt="There are plenty of statisics about how much can you make as a programmer" width="960" height="578" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">There are plenty of statisics about how much can you make as a programmer</p></div></p>
<p><strong>Starting Salary</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you first start learning to code, you’ll probably start with languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which help you become a front-end developer or designer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are entry-level positions that will give you the expertise and skills you need to continue in your career. The global average salary for a front-end developer is $51,000 and the average for a designer is $46,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re not aware of the difference between front-end and back-end development, check out our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/a-brief-introduction-to-web-development/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Introduction to Web Development</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have mastered the basics of front-end development, you should consider looking at jobs in back-end development. Working in this position will earn you an average salary of $56,000 globally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a relatively small raise, but it provides you with the opportunity to continue rising through the ranks and getting the highest paid jobs. </span></p>
<p><b>Highest Paying Jobs </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The growing demand for artificial intelligence and our ever-increasing reliance on technology continues to create plenty of high-paying opportunities for programmers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DevOps and machine learning are growing trends in the software industry today. Associated languages and frameworks are on the rise and software developers working in these areas command the highest salaries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll also want to learn the fundamentals of programming and become an expert in common languages, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, Python, and a few more. Knowledge of these languages will make you more versatile and capable as a programmer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to learning the most common programming languages and technologies, it’s important that you focus on a specific set of skills, like web development, systems programming or devops. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As in most careers, specialising will increase your abilities and your prospects. But don’t shy away from learning other things, too. You can never be too knowledgeable!</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12018 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h2>Why Computer Programmers Make So Much Money</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, we rely on technology for just about everything, including communication, entertainment, transportation, finances, and even dating. In fact, it’s hard to imagine our world without it.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the not-too-distant future, knowing how to code will likely become a requirement for all professions that is just as important as the ability to read and write. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, learning to program will not only open up new job opportunities in the future, but will also help you grow in your current career. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like the price of goods, both supply and demand determine the cost of workers in the job market. Currently, we are experiencing both a global shortage of coders and increasing demand from tech startups and established companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to high demand and low supply, programmers are bringing home great salaries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As technology continues to advance and becomes more prominent in our daily lives, salaries related to computer programming are bound to continue in an upward direction in the foreseeable future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter what hobbies or interests you may have, you can be sure that it involves technology. For example, you could combine your love for music with programming and become a sound engineer or use your coding skills and creative talents to create beautiful digital artwork. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you don’t consider yourself a creative or artistic person, learning to program will still help you in your career and personal development. </span></p>
<h2>Learning to Program Is a Good Investment</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Programming is one of the few professions that allows you to earn a six-figure salary, regardless of your level of education. Careers with similar salaries, such as engineering, medicine, and law, require you to spend incredible amounts of time and money to achieve the same results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Programming, on the other hand, allows you to reach the same level of financial success in just a fraction of the time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As long as you have the skills and the knowledge to get your job done, you won’t need to go into debt and attend a university for 4 years. Instead, you’ll be able to teach yourself online and learn through a variety of methods which we’ll discuss in our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”<a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/how-to-learn-to-code/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">How to Learn How to Code</a>”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> article. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is great news for those of us who didn’t have the opportunity to pursue higher education. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe that learning to code makes a positive impact on the world and allows the disadvantaged to make a modest living. In many countries where the minimum wage is below the poverty line, remote programming jobs give people opportunities that wouldn’t otherwise exist in their country.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To learn how CodeBerry is working to solve the global shortage of coders and is making a positive impact, check out our ‘<a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/press/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">press page</a>’. </span></p>
<h2>Will Learning to Code Get Me a Job?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning in-demand skills and sought-after programming languages will directly affect your earnings and your desirability as an employee. It will also prevent you from being replaced by new recruits that have a better understanding of current trends and technologies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To those of you who may be concerned about your age: have no fear. While many programmers and coders tend to be younger, professionals in their 40’s and 50’s should not be worried about beginning a new career in programming. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, entering the job market with up-to-date knowledge and recently learned skills can put you on the same level as new graduates and other young people in the job market. The key to getting a new job in programming at an older age is to stay humble, keep an open mind, and be willing to change.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many employers report that they prefer to hire younger prospects because of their willingness to change and adaptability—not their skills or experience. If you’re unwilling to eliminate old behaviors and replace old knowledge with new information, you might want to reconsider pursuing a career in technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, no set of skills or degree can completely guarantee you a job. It’s up to you to continuously learn, improve your skills, and search for new ways to future-proof yourself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if you’re going to learn any skill in 2019, learning to program is definitely one of your best options when it comes to finding a job and boosting your earning potential. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once a rather male-dominated field, programming has made large strides to be more inclusive. The number of female programmers has grown dramatically in recent years, with women showing more interest than ever in learning to code. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here at CodeBerry, at least 40% of our students are female—a percentage that we’d like to grow even larger.  </span></p>
<h2>How Much Will YOU Make?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How much you will make as a programmer can depend on a number of factors: your skill level, years of experience, and location.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to the internet and the ever-increasing popularity of remote work, your location is less of a factor than ever. Even if the average salary in your country may be rather low, working remotely gives you access to a global marketplace that values your skills and abilities over your geographical location. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll also want to learn how to market yourself well, whether you’re working as a freelancer or for a traditional company. Marketing yourself and creating a personal brand is especially important if you’re a freelancer and you are constantly dealing with short-term contracts and multiple clients to find work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regarding the specific skills needed to increase your earning potential, you can learn all about that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;<a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/which-programming-language-is-right-for-you/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Which programming language is good for you?</a>&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> article.  </span></p>
<h2>Additional Benefits of Learning How to Code</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, it’s pretty clear that learning how to write code will help you have high salaries. Are there any other benefits to learning this valuable skill? As it turns out, there are. Learning programming can help you in your personal development—not just in your career. </span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critical Thinking</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning to program will teach you about mathematics, logic, and critical thinking as you progress. Programming introduces you to topics such as boolean logic, variables, “if” statements, and other concepts that will improve your ability to think and construct logical arguments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, we know that you might be thinking, “I’ve never been good at math in my entire life.” That’s perfectly okay; most developers aren’t that great at math either. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more you learn and practice programming, the easier it will be to understand the overarching concepts. Don’t beat yourself up if you aren’t able to get it all on the first try; you’re still on time to catch up. </span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personal Projects</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most fun part about learning to code is the ability to create your own websites, games, programs, and mobile applications. Perhaps, you’ve always dreamed of having your own custom website for your portfolio, an app to keep you organized throughout the day, or your ideal videogame. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of these dreams can become a reality with programming. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe, you’ve considered creating a digital product or online service to start your own business and become an independent entrepreneur? In that case, you’ll definitely want to learn how to code to save yourself some money (now that you know how much programmers make). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being able to code will also give you complete freedom to create what you want. The only limit is your imagination and your time. </span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Future-proof Yourself </span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world is changing quickly and you definitely don’t want to be left behind. Even basic knowledge and understanding of code will help you to future-proof yourself and ensure that you don’t become obsolete in a technological landscape. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not just about getting a job either; learning to program will help you keep up with the modern world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business reports and projections continue to show that programming will only become more relevant in the coming years. That’s why it’s best to start learning as soon as you can. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Gábor Baranyi</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">used to work as a personal trainer, and also held training sessions for groups at a gym. Since then, he has found something that fulfils him, and where he can develop continuously: he is working as a junior frontend developer at a medium-sized company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>I live here:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Szeged, Hungary</span></p>
<p><b>I work here:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Minero IT Hungary KFT.</span></p>
<p><b>Time spent studying with CodeBerry</b><b>:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 10 months</span></p>
<p><b>I work with:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Fujitsu Lifebook A555, Windows 7, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntelliJ_IDEA" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">IntelliJ</a>, <a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">SourceTree</a></span></p>
<p><b>When you’re asked about your profession, how do you answer?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It depends on who’s asking.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If it is a professional in the field, I say a frontend developer. If it is a layperson showing some interest, my answer is that I am a programmer or software developer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>What did you do for a living before you switched to web development?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I used to work full time as a personal trainer and held group training sessions at a functional gym. I still offer these group sessions, in addition to working as a programmer.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><b>Why did you decide to start learning web development?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">always been interested in web design, in how and why a website looks as it does. Besides that, the gym&#8217;s webpage was partly managed by us, trainers, so I spent a lot of time writing and designing our WordPress blog, which I really enjoyed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I spotted a good opportunity on Facebook, where they advertised an online web develop</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> course. I looked it up, and I knew that I have to master the ins and outs of this profession on this platform&#8230; or at least the basics of it. It was the advertisement of CodeBerry.</span></p>
<p><b>How did you learn programming? What kind of courses, books etc. did you use?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After seeing the above-mentioned advertisement, I started to study at CodeBerry&#8217;s online course in September 2016, and later I added Codecademy and Udemy courses to my learning resources as well. I searched for and learned specific programming languages on video sharing sites.</span></p>
<p><b>What did CodeBerry offer you? What was it like to study at our school?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was very useful. I really liked your monthly subscription system, because this way I could study at my own pace. I loved the explanations, the examples through which the tasks are presented.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-6606 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Gabor_Baranyi_pic1.jpeg" alt="This is how a frontend developer’s desk looks like" width="760" height="427" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Gabor_Baranyi_pic1.jpeg 760w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Gabor_Baranyi_pic1-300x169.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gábor’s Desk</span></p>
<p><b>Do you have any experience, tips or tricks to share with those who are just starting their studies?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I find it very important to learn the basics well and to revise the earlier lessons to see the connections </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and to be able to put the new material in context. Revision is crucial.</span></p>
<p><b>Tell me a little about where you work now, what your duties are. What do you do on a typical day or week?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, I work at a Budapest based company&#8217;s office in Szeged. We are developing an internal project where I deal with the frontend, consisting of <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/a-brief-introduction-to-web-development/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I arrive at the office around 8 a.m. and I leave at 5 p.m. I try to do something different when I am not there; training or holding group training, so I can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">face the next working day energized and refreshed.</span></p>
<p><b>Who do you work with, and how do they help your work?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are currently about 20 people working in the office. I have a mentor helping me with my progress, who also supervises the project we are working on.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12018 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><b>What kind of software, tools or technologies do you work with currently?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The development environment is IntelliJ, for version control we use SourceTree and for repo, we use BitBucket.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the project, we use HTML, CSS (SCSS), jQuery, Angular JS, Angular Material and FUSE.</span></p>
<p><b>How long were you looking for a job? Was it hard to find a place to work?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actually, I was still studying when my friend suggest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ed that I s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">end my CV to the company he works for. They invited me for an int</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">erview, and a few weeks later they called me saying that they would like to work with me, based on my performance.</span></p>
<p><b>How was the interview process?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a brief introduction of the company, the interview continued in English, and it was my turn to introduce myself, talk a bit about my private life and about how and where I learned programming, also in English.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was followed by a technical part, where they assessed my knowledge and gave me a few logic tests to solve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The whole interview took about an hour.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12255 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><b>Do you have any advice for those who are currently preparing for a job interview?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is very important that everything you say has to be positive. Even if something negative comes up, try to talk about it from a positive aspect or perspective. Always stay confident, and show that you are able and willing to improve in any field.</span></p>
<p><b>What is the next step for you? What direction are you taking?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want to know as much about frontend development as possible and get a taste of backend development as well to see and understand the whole background process.</span></p>

</ul>
<h3><b>What is programming?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose that you work for a multinational company and you have an upcoming meeting with a businessman from China. Your native language is [insert local language] and you don’t speak a word of Chinese. However, you remember that your second language is English and that the Chinese businessman speaks English as well. You then begin to use English as a common language to negotiate and communicate with each other. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12017 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3><b>What language do computers speak?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A computer’s native language is binary: an incredibly long list of 1’s and 0’s. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Binary</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> isn’t very easy for people to read or write, so we came up with programming languages to talk with computers, instead. Since computers don’t know human languages, we have to meet in the middle somewhere. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, unlike humans, computers aren’t able to pick up on indirect communication and always take things very literally. If you tell them something, they will do it exactly as they are told. Computers aren’t smart enough to make decisions on their own and won’t understand information that isn’t spelt out for them. For this reason, you need to make sure that you’re giving them exact instructions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if I told you to make a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sandwich</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you might ask me what ingredients I want on that sandwich and if I want it toasted or not. To you, that might be all you need to know to make me a delicious sandwich. However, there are many small decisions and previous knowledge involved in making a sandwich. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you simply tell a computer that you want a toasted ham and cheese sandwich with rye bread and mayonnaise, you might get something very different from what you ordered. A human would know that the mayonnaise goes on the slices of bread first, the ham and cheese are added second, then the sandwich is placed in the oven to be toasted. </span></p>
<h3><b>But, how is a computer supposed to know all</b> that?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember that we told the computer that we want, “a toasted ham and cheese sandwich with rye bread and mayonnaise.” To a computer, it might be logical to do all of those things in order. It would toast the ham and cheese by themselves, put two slices of rye bread on top, and then spread mayonnaise on the bread. </span></p>
<h3>Aren’t computers supposed to be smarter than that?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, because the computer takes things</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> literally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you have to specify the order of each step and the placement of each ingredient. Everyone knows that the ingredients go between the pieces of bread, but a computer has no previous knowledge of what a sandwich is like—it’s just following your direct instructions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is another reason why we can’t communicate with computers using human languages, just yet. Our languages are simply too ambiguous and too vague for a computer to understand properly. Also, if a word or a sentence might have a double meaning, a computer wouldn’t know how to interpret it. It needs everything spelt out for it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The truth is that computers aren’t smart at all; they just happen to process information faster than us. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6210" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/code.2-1.jpg" alt="" width="5472" height="3648" /></p>
<h3>What is a programmer and what do they do?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember, you can’t just tell the computer in English what you want. You’ll need a computer programmer to translate for you. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A computer programmer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a person who communicates your ideas and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">instructions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to a computer, making websites, games, and other programs appear on the screen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A programmer could also be defined as a polyglot (one who knows many languages) that specializes in talking to computers. They know exactly what to say and how to say it so that the computer will understand them. If you’ve ever learned another language, you know that each language comes with its own vocabulary, grammar, and set of rules. Computer languages also come with their own way of saying things, called syntax. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a person might understand you if you </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mispronounce</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a word, use the wrong conjugation, or mess up your grammar, a computer is a lot less forgiving with mistakes. As soon as you make a syntax error, the computer will stop listening to you and quit running the program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How rude. </span></p>
<h3>What are you able to accomplish with coding skills?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve ever used a computer, watched videos online, or played video games, it might be hard to believe that all of that comes from just a series of letters and symbols. The ability to process thousands of lines of code per second is the strength of a computer and allows it to follow highly complex instructions and accomplish incredible tasks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s take a look at some of the cool things you can do with code:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create &amp; Design Websites</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Build Mobile Apps</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Develop Desktop Programs</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Develop Video Games</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create &amp; Maintain Databases</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automate Tasks</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solve Complex Problems</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create Artificial Intelligence</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perform Statistical Analysis</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And much more&#8230;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re interested in any of these activities and would like to do them for a living, learning to program is definitely an important skill to have. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12028 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3>What makes coding useful and what is it good for?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we rely more and more on computers in our daily lives, the importance of computer programming and coding continues to grow as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the coming years, nearly all fields will involve computer programming and learning to code will give you an edge in your future career. For example, you can use programming skills in the areas of writing, analysis, management, engineering, software development, and so much more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advocates of programming see learning to code as a universal skill that everyone should have, such as the ability to read and write or perform simple mathematical equations. Many governments around the world believe this as well and have proposed initiatives to teach coding to kids alongside core curriculum in schools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like us, they see coding as the key to staying competitive in a global marketplace. </span></p>
<h3>I already know it’s useful, but what is programming actually like?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average day in the life of a programmer isn’t as glamorous as it might appear in movies or on television shows. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being a programmer requires a lot of concentration, patience, and a self-driven attitude. If you aren’t able to sit down and focus for hours at a time, you might want to reconsider pursuing a career in computer programming. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some programming jobs may require you to work on an irregular schedule and be available to fix bugs and solve problems immediately as they appear. Others may have you work from nine to five o’clock, just like a regular job. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, working as a computer programmer might give you more freedom than your current job allows. A good number of programming jobs are remote, meaning that you can code while at home, at a café, or while you get a tan at the beach—given that the wifi signal reaches that far. </span></p>
<h3>Is programming really right for me?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where the rubber meets the road and where you’ll have to seriously weigh the computer programmer pros and cons. Perhaps, you’ve had an unrealistic idea of what programming is like and haven’t considered that coding is just like any other job out there—it’s still hard work. However, if you meet the following criteria, chances are that you’ll love every second of it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Signs that Programming Isn’t Right for You:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are only motivated by money and aren’t interested in computers at all</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t like to sit down for long periods of time</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your eyes glaze over when you look at a page of code</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are relatively slow at typing and often make many typos</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Signs that Programming IS Right For You:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You describe yourself as both analytical AND creative</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have high attention to detail</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are comfortable working with others and working alone</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have a good basis for understanding written English</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You love problem-solving</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You love to always learn new things</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You adapt well to change</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You like to organize information and automate processes</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>What programming languages do I choose and where do I start?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s go back to the example of our meeting with the Chinese businessman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although English may be useful in a business setting, you might find that you need to learn other languages for different fields. For example, you might want to know French for diplomacy, Greek for philosophy, and German in the field of engineering. Depending on what field you work in, you will choose a specific language to meet your needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You won’t have the time or ability to learn every programming language out there, so you’ll need to be strategic about what languages you will learn. First, you need to determine what your focus is and what languages you need to know to accomplish your personal goals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While technically not programming languages, HTML and CSS are great languages to start with to begin learning the fundamentals of how programming works. HTML and CSS are “text markup languages” which are actually languages that we use to format and organize the text. Without HTML or CSS, your browser wouldn’t know if these words I’m writing are a headline, a paragraph, or a footer. It also wouldn’t know if these words should be bolded, italicized, etc. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even as I write this article, I am using HTML and CSS to help you and your internet browser understand what I have to say. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12019 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3>TL;DR (Too Long; Didn’t Read)</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In summary, programming is a high-paying career that requires patience, dedication, and extremely high attention to detail. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you hate sitting down at a computer and aren’t willing to put in the time to practice, you’ll likely hate programming and give up rather quickly. You also won’t do well if you are motivated by the paycheck and have no interest in the job itself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if you love learning new things, are self-motivated, and have a can-do attitude, you’ll succeed—regardless of your educational background.</span></p>
