										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Gábor Baranyi</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">used to work as a personal trainer, and also held training sessions for groups at a gym. Since then, he has found something that fulfils him, and where he can develop continuously: he is working as a junior frontend developer at a medium-sized company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>I live here:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Szeged, Hungary</span></p>
<p><b>I work here:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Minero IT Hungary KFT.</span></p>
<p><b>Time spent studying with CodeBerry</b><b>:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 10 months</span></p>
<p><b>I work with:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Fujitsu Lifebook A555, Windows 7, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntelliJ_IDEA" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">IntelliJ</a>, <a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">SourceTree</a></span></p>
<p><b>When you’re asked about your profession, how do you answer?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It depends on who’s asking.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If it is a professional in the field, I say a frontend developer. If it is a layperson showing some interest, my answer is that I am a programmer or software developer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>What did you do for a living before you switched to web development?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I used to work full time as a personal trainer and held group training sessions at a functional gym. I still offer these group sessions, in addition to working as a programmer.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><b>Why did you decide to start learning web development?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">always been interested in web design, in how and why a website looks as it does. Besides that, the gym&#8217;s webpage was partly managed by us, trainers, so I spent a lot of time writing and designing our WordPress blog, which I really enjoyed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I spotted a good opportunity on Facebook, where they advertised an online web develop</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> course. I looked it up, and I knew that I have to master the ins and outs of this profession on this platform&#8230; or at least the basics of it. It was the advertisement of CodeBerry.</span></p>
<p><b>How did you learn programming? What kind of courses, books etc. did you use?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After seeing the above-mentioned advertisement, I started to study at CodeBerry&#8217;s online course in September 2016, and later I added Codecademy and Udemy courses to my learning resources as well. I searched for and learned specific programming languages on video sharing sites.</span></p>
<p><b>What did CodeBerry offer you? What was it like to study at our school?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was very useful. I really liked your monthly subscription system, because this way I could study at my own pace. I loved the explanations, the examples through which the tasks are presented.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-6606 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Gabor_Baranyi_pic1.jpeg" alt="This is how a frontend developer’s desk looks like" width="760" height="427" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Gabor_Baranyi_pic1.jpeg 760w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Gabor_Baranyi_pic1-300x169.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gábor’s Desk</span></p>
<p><b>Do you have any experience, tips or tricks to share with those who are just starting their studies?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I find it very important to learn the basics well and to revise the earlier lessons to see the connections </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and to be able to put the new material in context. Revision is crucial.</span></p>
<p><b>Tell me a little about where you work now, what your duties are. What do you do on a typical day or week?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, I work at a Budapest based company&#8217;s office in Szeged. We are developing an internal project where I deal with the frontend, consisting of <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/a-brief-introduction-to-web-development/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I arrive at the office around 8 a.m. and I leave at 5 p.m. I try to do something different when I am not there; training or holding group training, so I can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">face the next working day energized and refreshed.</span></p>
<p><b>Who do you work with, and how do they help your work?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are currently about 20 people working in the office. I have a mentor helping me with my progress, who also supervises the project we are working on.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12018 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><b>What kind of software, tools or technologies do you work with currently?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The development environment is IntelliJ, for version control we use SourceTree and for repo, we use BitBucket.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the project, we use HTML, CSS (SCSS), jQuery, Angular JS, Angular Material and FUSE.</span></p>
<p><b>How long were you looking for a job? Was it hard to find a place to work?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actually, I was still studying when my friend suggest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ed that I s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">end my CV to the company he works for. They invited me for an int</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">erview, and a few weeks later they called me saying that they would like to work with me, based on my performance.</span></p>
<p><b>How was the interview process?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a brief introduction of the company, the interview continued in English, and it was my turn to introduce myself, talk a bit about my private life and about how and where I learned programming, also in English.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was followed by a technical part, where they assessed my knowledge and gave me a few logic tests to solve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The whole interview took about an hour.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12255 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><b>Do you have any advice for those who are currently preparing for a job interview?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is very important that everything you say has to be positive. Even if something negative comes up, try to talk about it from a positive aspect or perspective. Always stay confident, and show that you are able and willing to improve in any field.</span></p>
<p><b>What is the next step for you? What direction are you taking?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want to know as much about frontend development as possible and get a taste of backend development as well to see and understand the whole background process.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Márton Radnóczi</strong>, Marci is an agronomist specialised in rural development. He&#8217;s been passionate about web and mobile related products from day one, finally last year he decided to devote more time to them. He now works at Apertus Ltd. as a sitebuilder.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I live here:</strong> Budapest, Hungary</p>
<p><strong>I work here:</strong> Apertus Ltd.</p>
<p><strong>Time spent studying with CodeBerry:</strong> 6 months</p>
<p><strong>I work with:</strong> Oneplus One, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">PhpStorm</a>, Adobe*</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>When you&#8217;re asked about your profession, how do you answer?</strong></h3>
<p>Briefly: I’m a site builder or web developer. I build websites without a function. My task is to convert sketches into code, so the desired design appears in the browser.</p>
<h3><strong>What did you do for a living before you started coding? Did you have any relevant experience in this field?</strong></h3>
<p>I worked in finance before I became a project manager in a startup. I&#8217;ve never learned to code, I just had an idea of how things worked and what logic they followed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12018 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Why did you decide to start <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/a-brief-introduction-to-web-development/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">studying web development</a>?</strong></h3>
<p>It always appealed to me as a hobby. Time flew by when I started digging into related topics, I felt unstoppable. It was an unmistakable flow experience I&#8217;ve never experienced before during work. I liked the thought of doing this full-time. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h3><strong>Tell me a little about where you work now, what your duties are. What do you do on a typical day or week?</strong></h3>
<p>We develop various size web systems at Apertus Ltd. As a site builder, my role is to create a static page out of a specified design or just simple sketches. Most of the time I get a few pictures that guide my code. I work on numerous projects simultaneously, but normally I focus on just one each day.</p>
<h3><strong>How long were you looking for a job? Was it hard to find a place to work?</strong></h3>
<p>I searched for 1 week, so I admit it was surprisingly easy. I suspected it would be fast, but not this fast though.</p>

<h3><strong>How did you learn programming? What kind of courses, books etc. did you use?</strong></h3>
<p>I only enrolled in online courses. First, I tested myself on free materials and then I paid for two that complemented each other. I also watched tutorials on Youtube to gain a deeper insight into some interesting topics.</p>
<h3><strong>What did CodeBerry offer you? What was it like to study at our school?</strong></h3>
<p>The biggest advantage of CodeBerry is that it gives an overview of the whole process of web development, guiding you step by step through all the different stages. This helps you decide which part of it fits you most.</p>

<h3><strong>Do you have any experience, tips or tricks to share with those who are just starting their studies?</strong></h3>
<p>Web development has many different areas, it’s worth choosing a few to focus on, and just briefly know the others. If you ever need more, you can always learn it then.</p>
<h3><strong>What is the next step for you? What direction are you taking?</strong></h3>
<p>I would like to learn as much as possible and bring some of my own ideas to life. I’ve never let go of my agricultural knowledge, it will be exciting to see how it might come together with IT.</p>
