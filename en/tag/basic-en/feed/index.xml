										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Balázs Gergely Soós</strong>, BeeGee is a graduate computer science engineer with a PhD from the PPKE Multidisciplinary Doctoral School of Sciences and Technology, also an alumni member of the BME Schönherz College &#8211; and now also a student of <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">CodeBerry</a>. He formerly worked for SZTAKI as a research assistant, was a research engineer at Searchlab, senior developer and founder of Streamnovation and leader programmer at Zinemath.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I live here</strong>: Budapest, Hungary</p>
<p><strong>I work here</strong>: MorganStanley</p>
<p><strong>Time spent studying with <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">CodeBerry</a></strong>: 3 months</p>
<p><strong>I work with</strong>:HP ENVY, Samsung Galaxy S4 mini, Chrome, <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Notepad++</a>, <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/gitk" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">gitk</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h4>When you&#8217;re asked about your profession, how do you answer?</h4>
<p>I’m a software developer.</p>
<h4>What was your job before you started coding? Did you have any former experience in this field?</h4>
<p>When I was a child I used to look for swapped O’s and zeros in BASIC programs. I gave up an aircraft modelling workshop to draw with a Commodore+4 and I was often fiddling with GV-Basic (C64) too. I used Tubo Pascal in high school and <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/beginners-guide-to-c/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">C++</a> at university among other interesting languages. <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/beginners-guide-to-c/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">C++</a> stuck with me for quite a long time… and then machine vision, robotics and GPU programming came along.</p>
<h4>Why did you decide to start learning web development?</h4>
<p>In my opinion desktop applications are done for. Instead, I was interested in mobile development and cloud services. I wanted to learn WebGL after coming across it for the first time. I thought the first step should be recalling my web knowledge, as I had previously dealt with some <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/beginners-guide-to-php/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">PHP</a> and MySQL, but the frontend was always done by someone else. Many of my projects focused on calculation, not the interface. However, I became curious about the tricks done by <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/g/gui.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">GUI wizards</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h4>Please tell us more about what you do now, what tasks you have? What happens on a typical day?</h4>
<p>I work in a bank, so that’s a secret. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> But my job includes some daily frontend tasks.</p>
<h4>How long were you looking for a job? How did you land your current position?</h4>
<p>My previous one was like a dream job: a real dreamer mastermind, fantastic engineers, international exhibitions and a rock-solid investor. But one day I felt like it was all too much. I needed some peace and quiet to be able to hear some new voices and finally have time for my family and myself.</p>
<p>This impulse hit me in the summer. My wife had 4 weeks off, so we moved to Venice for the time. Relaxing by the lakeside made me realise how much I’m missing some intellectual activity, so I started studying…</p>
<p>Two months later I had a couple of interviews. When the news of me not working got around, one of my dorm fellows called me and said if I still love those special program languages and I’m interested in big databases, then he has an empty desk for me by his side…</p>
<h4>How did you learn programming? What kind of courses, books etc. did you use?</h4>
<p>I don’t remember anymore, it just happened. I possessed a few issues with Computerbooks. The next thing was university: György Pongor and Zoltán László. After that, I kept to online materials.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8548" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/home-office-336373_1920-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="As a Codeberry student you can learn everywhere" width="1024" height="683" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/home-office-336373_1920-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/home-office-336373_1920-1-300x200.jpg 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/home-office-336373_1920-1-768x512.jpg 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/home-office-336373_1920-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/home-office-336373_1920-1-1080x720.jpg 1080w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/home-office-336373_1920-1.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h4>&#8220;What did CodeBerry offer you? What was it like to study at our school?</h4>
<p>I read about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Node.js</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_(web_framework)" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Angular</a> and could feel the power of their combination. During my doctorate years, I fell in love with independent research, the joy of discovering something new. On the other hand, I do respect teachers who gave me a good kickstart before the journey. Learning out of blogs is really like being in a big city without a map: there are dozens of buses, many tramlines and a few undergrounds. Sometimes you need help with the directions if you actually want to get somewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/andras-p-toth-serial-entrepreneur/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Andris</a> and I meet each other every month. He told me about CodeBerry when it was just a twinkle in his eye. Later <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/web-development-story-of-arpad-binecz/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Bini</a> said he likes the idea. I thought: why not? I was probably one of the first twenty applicants. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Before it wasn’t my job to make something pretty. At the beginning of the lessons, the focus was on the frontend. I didn’t regret that though. It was very useful to be able to try everything I just learned and test my knowledge with quizzes. By the time I completed a WordPress site, CSS and I became great friends.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12255 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h4>Do you have any experience, tips or tricks to share with those who are just starting their studies?</h4>
<p>You just have to sit down and do it… I got the final push from a friend of mine: he asked me to create a responsive website for him. He took advantage of me not working at the time. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h4>What is the next step for you? What direction are you taking?</h4>
<p>As soon as I&#8217;ll have a few spare weekends, I&#8217;ll steer back to my original goal, WebGL. Maybe Spiced up with some VR.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Adam Freisinger</strong> finished his studies as a Pharmacist and Health Care Manager, but ended up working as a web developer. Since then he has founded two IT companies. One of them being <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">CodeBerry</a>, a programming school that teaches web development online in english.</p>
<p>Tune in to read more about adventure games written in BASIC, winding copper wires for RAM cores and artificial intelligence. Along with that, we&#8217;ll also discuss the entrepreneur lifestyle of Adam Freisinger.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I live in: </strong>Budapest, Hungary.</p>
<p><strong>I work:</strong> wherever my laptop is / CodeBerry programming school</p>
<p><strong>I work with:</strong> my iPhone, MacBook Air and Sublime Text.</p>
<p>I have an efficient work style.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What do you do for a living?</strong></p>
<p>I help people learn to code.</p>
<p><strong>Tell me more about what you do regarding programming?</strong></p>
<p>I improve <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">lesson content</a> for Codeberry, so they are easier to teach and more comprehensible. This involves less coding and more creative thinking.<br />
In my free time, I fiddle with my hobby projects, that are normally tools for things I’m interested in. Recently I built the following three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>A social playlist for Spotify,</li>
<li>A Chrome extension, that quotes famous books on a new tab,</li>
<li>Software that allows me to organize my projects as well as my CodeBerry goals.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How does your workspace look like?</strong></p>
<p>I feel best in a minimalistic environment, so my desk only contains things I use:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-5810 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Adam_Freisinger_pic1-2.jpeg" alt="That’s the place where the lessons of Codeberry are made" width="800" height="600" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">My workstation (Credit: Adam Freisinger)</p>
<p><strong>When, where and how did you learn to code?</strong></p>
<p>I got a computer when I was in elementary school and my parents thought I needed to know how to use it. So, every week a friend would come over and teach me the fundamentals. I really enjoyed writing my first run-around adventure game in BASIC.</p>
<p>I continued with things I found interesting, like writing a <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/dcplusplus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">DC++</a> chatbot or building a website for my father. When they published the new version of Meteor framework I couldn&#8217;t resist building a web application with it.</p>
<p>Most of my knowledge comes from searching the internet. I would browse a larger topic, then dig deeper into puzzling details.</p>
<p><strong>What are the job opportunities for web developers? On average, how much time did you spend looking for a job?</strong></p>
<p>Due to the fact that I graduated as a Pharmacist and Health Care Manager, I never looked for jobs in programming. I took on some small tasks that found me and lead to bigger tasks. Now, I&#8217;m working in my own company taking on several roles, whatever&#8217;s needed.</p>
<p>Seeing that people regularly contact me on <a href="http://linkedin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="http://upwork.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Upwork</a>, even with very little information available, this is a demanding job.</p>
<p><strong>What is your schedule like?</strong></p>
<p>I like to get up early because it&#8217;s still quiet both inside and out. I plan my day, drink some fruit juice and start working after breakfast. I also go over special events that happened on the previous day.</p>
<p>During a business week, the first one and a half days are dedicated to strategy and Friday is for reviews. Between the two I have time to work without distractions.</p>
<p>I like reviewing my personal life too, my partner and I write down each week things we enjoyed and others that need changing.</p>
<p>Twice a week I try to meet somebody for lunch that I haven&#8217;t seen for a while.</p>
<p>My weeks, months and years are similar to my days. I like to plan at the beginning of each period and look back at the end to attempt to learn from it. Every month, I collect the photos I have taken from the previous month. I also complete the <a href="http://www.yearcompass.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">YearCompass</a> every year.</p>
<p><strong>Is there something you know that would surprise everyday people?</strong></p>
<p>Programming is not magic. It mostly involves internet research. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><strong>Who do you work with?</strong></p>
<p>I work with my friends that I have worked with for eight years on projects like Codeberry.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What are the typical career paths in your profession?</strong></p>
<p>As a Pharmacist, I could have walked a well-defined life path, but I left that certainty behind. Right now, my task is to do things within the company that requires me to reach beyond the limits of what is known.</p>
<p>This gives me the opportunity to constantly learn something new and improve myself. I don&#8217;t have a certain path before me now and it makes me feel like I can become anything I want.</p>
<p><strong>What are your plans, how do you wish to continue?</strong></p>
<p>The expression &#8220;jack of all trades, master of none&#8221; describes my path best. I would like to experience as many things as I can and learn a little about each of them. I am much like a duck wanting to both fly and swim, however, not mastering either of them.</p>
<p>I hope to find a winding path between &#8220;some trades&#8221; and &#8220;all trades.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>What other profession would you choose if you had to change? Could you change?</strong></p>
<p>I wouldn’t want to change.</p>
<p><strong>What skills do great developers, IT experts require? Who do you not recommend this profession to?</strong></p>
<p>There are a few skills that don’t hurt:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strong analytical thinking,</li>
<li>An experimenting spirit,</li>
<li>Attention to details.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What’s your favourite part?</strong></p>
<p>I enjoy seeing fast results. I can change the world by simply editing a code. I would probably be a terrible nuclear power plant designer, who plans something with all their heart then, if lucky, sees the steps of their design begin several years later.</p>

<p><strong>What grinds your gears most? What are the difficulties and dangers of your profession?</strong></p>
<p>You no longer need to know how to build RAM modules to browse websites. Similarly, there are plenty of pre-written programs that stop you from seeing things further.</p>
<p>It makes me mad when I have to rewrite a login module, instead of taking advantage of pre-defined elements. There are too many different solutions for the same problem, we&#8217;re being inefficient this way.</p>
<p><strong>How stable is your job? How much time does one spend working for the same company?</strong></p>
<p>Right now, I’m pretty sure I would find a job.<br />
I feel lucky because I can afford to work somewhere as long as I can focus on my tasks, improve and learn new things. If this changed, I would want to quit.</p>
<p><strong>If you had to ask for one thing in the name of all developers, what would it be?</strong></p>
<p>Please don’t write the same code twice. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><strong>How much can one earn in this profession (as a newbie, experienced and veteran)?</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to the years spent saving some money, I now have the opportunity to work for my own business. I hope we can afford some paychecks soon, as now only my enthusiasm pushes me forward.</p>

<p><strong>What do you think is the best way to learn to code?</strong></p>
<p>One answer doesn’t fit all, everyone has to learn the way they can do best. For me, it’s easiest via real projects. Whenever I’m stuck I just seek help.</p>
<p><strong>What makes code worth learning?</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, programming is like a foreign language; it helps understand other cultures and change your entire life if you want it to. Secondly, it’s a profession that surely won’t disappear in the next decades (or until artificial intelligence takes over).</p>
