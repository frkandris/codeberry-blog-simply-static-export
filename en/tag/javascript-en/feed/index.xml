										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you want to learn one of the most popular programming languages that make finding a job a child&#8217;s play? Do you want employers to chase after you with the best jobs?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get a firm grasp of one (or more) of the programming languages below, and if your knowledge stands on firm grounds, we bet you will find a job quickly, and your programming skills will be compensated with a high salary.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the most popular programming languages?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world of technology is ever-changing, so the list of the most popular programming languages changes too:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are languages that seem like they can never be removed from the top 10 (e.g., Java, Python, JavaScript, SQL). </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, we noticed some trends in popularity—some technologies are used less and less (e.g., PHP) while others are used more widely (e.g., JavaScript).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They are also always creating new languages and technologies to solve the tasks of a particular area even more efficiently (e.g., R).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ones higher on the list of the most popular programming languages are general-purpose languages with a long history (like Java), but there are newer ones on the top 10 list as well, that have been developed for more special purposes (like R and MATLAB).</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we based our list on the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summaries of international trends: </span><a href="https://go.courses/blog/all-the-programming-languages-worth-learning-in-2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go Courses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://medium.com/@satyanageshan8/the-7-most-used-programming-languages-in-2019-and-2020-predictions-29c715c3f456" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">medium.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://hackr.io/blog/best-programming-languages-to-learn-2020-jobs-future" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hackr.io</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stackoverflow Developer Survey</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also looked at job-posting websites to see how many ads contain the programming languages below. In our article, we used the numbers of the website </span><a href="https://hu.indeed.com/jobs?q=java&amp;l=Hungary" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, since that is a meta job-posting site, meaning they compile the jobs from many other job sites. The numbers were accurate during the writing of this article, but job offers always change somewhat, of course.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Java</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Write Once, Run Anywhere”. This is what gives Java its popularity since programs written in this language can be run on any compatible device without recompiling them if Java has been installed. It is a general-purpose language that has versatile uses, like website development, or creating mobile and desktop applications. There are other Java versions available for corporate servers and other business applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also have to mention that Android is Java-based, there are many Java applications for Windows, and the corporate world and back-end programming also build heavily on this language, adding to the wide variety of job options.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 1038 Java-based programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article.</span></p>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Python</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is an easily readable, general-purpose language with an easy syntax. We can recommend this to beginners as well since Python is one of the most suitable programming languages to start learning the basics of programming. It stands on or near the top of the lists of the most popular, the most well-liked by programmers, and the easiest to learn programming languages, and has been on top for years now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine learning and AI development are the fastest developing areas of use for Python. It is also the most often used language in data science, but it isn’t unknown in the world of web programming and game development either.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 740 Python programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article.</span></p>

</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">JavaScript </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is mostly a language of websites. It is used primarily for front-end development, as this language makes most websites more interactive and dynamic, but it is starting to gain popularity on the server-side as well, with the help of the software system Node.js.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All steps of web development, and prior to that, UI and UX design (meaning the creation of user-friendly, good-looking and modern websites) have a great value on the labour market—we always need web developers. You can’t go wrong with this knowledge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 651 JavaScript programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article. </span></p>

</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">One step forward: TypeScript </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TypeScript is a scripting language created by Microsoft. The goal of developing it wasn’t the creation of another rival language, but making a tool that expands the possibilities of JavaScript so that we can do massive projects with it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 172 programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article that requires TypeScript skills or lists them as an advantage.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">C# </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With C#, we can create desktop, mobile, and web-based applications, and with the .NET framework makes it even easier to develop things for tools created by Microsoft and the Windows operating system. This framework has fused together with C# almost completely, they are usually mentioned together, and job offers generally require you to know the framework as well as the language.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are other software development platforms for C#, e.g., Unity, which has been created for game development and has since become the engine for many known games.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C# can also be suitable for writing websites and web applications using the ASP.NET framework.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C# can be used independently from Microsoft—you can write software for Xbox, Android, macOS and many more platforms.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 434 C# programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">SQL</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Structured Query Language is the standard language for data management. In our data-centric world, databases that store and process huge amounts of data are indispensable parts of our tools and services’ background processes. Experts who can create and manage databases like this are in high demand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning SQL is a worthy investment, and if you also have some other programming, data analysis, or data visualization skills, you can have a job basically anywhere since, as we have mentioned before, databases are needed everywhere.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 1300 programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article that requires SQL skills. </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12028 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">C++</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a low-level, close-to-hardware programming language that is hard to read and it is the upgraded version of the widely used C language, which is the basis for many systems. Learning this language requires strong IT and mathematical skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This language usually isn’t recommended for beginners, but this article is about programming languages that can help you find a job, and C++ certainly is one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can be used to create and fine-tune operating systems, device drivers, video games, and even desktop and mobile apps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are not a beginner, or if you are looking for long-term goals, C++ can be an amazing choice since C++ skills are valuable on the labour market. Corporations need highly-trained C++ developers who can complete especially complex and serious programming tasks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This valuable knowledge is compensated with a high salary, and senior C++ developers are among the most well-paid programmers. As newer and newer programming languages start to appear that are easier to use, the number of C++ developers are decreasing, so you are almost guaranteed a job if you are capable of working professionally in this complex language</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 362 C++ programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article.</span></p>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">PHP</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a scripting language used in web development and database management that is relatively easy to learn, and there are good and well-paid opportunities for it from the very beginning. It is popular and in high demand because one of the most popular website creation applications, WordPress, is running in PHP as well. In 2018, 83.5% of websites choose PHP as their server-side programming language, including such tech giants as Facebook, Tumblr or Slack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web developers, and more specifically, back-end or full-stack developers have many job options if they know and use PHP confidently.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 259 PHP programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">R</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">R is a field-specific programming language, used mostly for statistical analyses and the representation of their results. Nowadays, data science is a highly important and dynamically expanding area, so there are many job offers for writing statistical software and data analysis. R also plays a role in machine learning, which is also an important area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since statistical analysis is used in many fields—sciences and human research, commerce, marketing, and meteorology to name a few, R programming skills can be crucial for us not just as members of development teams, but for research groups and other things as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the infinite amount of data we are working within the 21st century, experts in data analysis and exploring correlations are becoming indispensable. So people can be sure that they will find positions in which they can make use of their R skills.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 187 programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article that mentions R.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perl</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previously, the most important language of the web had been Perl, also called “The Duct Tape of the Internet.” Today, other languages have gained considerable ground, but Perl is still a widely used general-purpose language.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They use Perl in system administration, programming networks, creating graphical user interfaces, and, of course, web development is also still on the table.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 129 Perl programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">MATLAB programming language</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lists of most popular programming languages are created using different criteria, but if we are looking at which languages are in high demand on the labour market, MatLab appears on more and more of them. MatLab is both the name of the development environment and the programming language used in that environment. It has been developed mostly for performing technical calculations, developing and testing algorithms, and creating simulations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is often used for a visual representation of scientific test results and data processing tasks. If you already have high mathematical skills or knowledge of some field of science, MatLab can become a valuable asset.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 76 MatLab programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swift </span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swift is a general-purpose, high-level programming language developed by Apple. It can be used to write programs for macOS, iOS or other Apple operating systems. It has many modern features that make development easier and more secure. It stands out from other programming languages for the same purpose in that programs are written in Swift run extremely quickly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The importance of Apple is unquestionable in the world of IT, so even if Swift isn’t one of the most popular programming languages yet, it is quickly rising, and you can already find a lot of jobs if you know it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 75 Swift programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nowadays, we don’t use the internet just for getting information, reading, watching videos and movies, or listening to music—we also shape the content by using social media, posting, commenting, chatting, using web applications, shopping in online stores, planning routes, and so on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Complex development teams work together to operate the many functions above—different members are responsible for different areas, and they are using various technologies and programming languages to achieve this. At a well-chosen web development course, you can learn all the know-how of this segment.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12017 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main areas of web development</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Web development is usually separated into two big areas (front-end and back-end),</strong> and there’s another term for people who have <strong>comprehensive knowledge of both areas (full stack).</strong> In this article, we collected courses that can help you learn about these areas of web development and acquire the skills necessary to work in these fields.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Front-end</span></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/326514/pexels-photo-326514.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;dpr=2&amp;h=750&amp;w=1260" alt="web development courses" width="503" height="336" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the areas of web development is front-end development, i.e., the <strong>creation and maintenance of interfaces seen by the user.</strong> Client-side programming means creating and maintaining dynamic and responsive websites using plans from graphic artists and designers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a front-end developer, <strong>you have to be familiar with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</strong> In addition, it is also useful to know <strong>frameworks and libraries like Angular, jQuery, or React.</strong></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back-end</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another web development area we usually talk about separately is back-end development which means <strong>server-side programming and maintenance</strong>. Back-end developers create background processes and build communication with databases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some often-used server-side programming languages:<strong> Java, PHP, SQL, Python, Ruby, Node.js, ASP.NET. </strong></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full-stack</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are <strong>IT specialists that are familiar with both back-end and front-end development</strong>, i.e., they understand the whole web development process. Both background processes and the maintenance of user interfaces require complex knowledge, therefore front-end, back-end, and full-stack developers are all sought-after on the labour market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can read more about </span><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/introduction-to-web-development/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the basics of web development</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if you need more information.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web development courses</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are interested in this area and would like to work as a web developer, <strong>you should apply to a course</strong> you like and start learning web languages. The courses listed in this post have different goals, so they teach different technologies. In time, it will become important to make clear what you want to do so that you can learn things accordingly.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. </span><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/hu/weboldal-keszites-tanfolyam/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CodeBerry &#8211; Website Creation Course </span></a><i></i></h3>
<ul>
<li><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">19.990 Ft/month</span></i></li>

<li><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online, with mentorship</span></i></li>
<li><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">From beginner level</span></i></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can learn the<strong> basics of HTML, CSS3,</strong> and the use of online and offline editors during the course. After successfully completing it, you will be able to create modern websites by yourself. The course is online, and <strong>experienced mentors help you</strong> along the way if you get stuck. You can learn individually, and according to your schedule. <strong>No prior knowledge is required</strong>—just your interest and commitment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <strong>The course takes up 5 hours of your time per week,</strong> and you can create exciting new interfaces, e.g., the main page of a blog or the user interface of a chat app. You will get constant feedback on your work from the mentors so that your development becomes even faster.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I always wanted to know how I can create a great website since I had blogs, personal websites, journals, yet I could never make them my own through formatting. I had minimal HTML knowledge when I started the Website Creation module, and it is incredible how much I learned from it even on the first day. I am grateful for the opportunity to access these fantastic lessons anytime, anywhere, with completely understandable materials at a reasonable price.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” &#8211; Attila Szabó (Facebook)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides <strong>detached programming courses,</strong> Lynda.com offers <strong>complete learning paths.</strong> If you’d like to start studying and have long-term plans to improve your skills, but some extra guidelines would be helpful, you can choose this option. In this case, you don’t have to worry about creating learning plans and search fitting courses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have already found your favourite course, <strong>you have the opportunity to follow all of the content provided by the same author.</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your goal is just to get familiar with web development tools first, you can choose a <strong>single beginner course</strong>, but there are also <strong>specializations</strong> which are useful if you already code and need some extra knowledge for a project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pluralsight has a <strong>monthly fee to use,</strong> but there are other options as well, like <strong>annual billing and premium access,</strong> which provides you with more <strong>interactive content and extended materials.</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Gábor Baranyi</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">used to work as a personal trainer, and also held training sessions for groups at a gym. Since then, he has found something that fulfils him, and where he can develop continuously: he is working as a junior frontend developer at a medium-sized company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>I live here:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Szeged, Hungary</span></p>
<p><b>I work here:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Minero IT Hungary KFT.</span></p>
<p><b>Time spent studying with CodeBerry</b><b>:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 10 months</span></p>
<p><b>I work with:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Fujitsu Lifebook A555, Windows 7, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntelliJ_IDEA" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">IntelliJ</a>, <a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">SourceTree</a></span></p>
<p><b>When you’re asked about your profession, how do you answer?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It depends on who’s asking.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If it is a professional in the field, I say a frontend developer. If it is a layperson showing some interest, my answer is that I am a programmer or software developer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>What did you do for a living before you switched to web development?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I used to work full time as a personal trainer and held group training sessions at a functional gym. I still offer these group sessions, in addition to working as a programmer.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><b>Why did you decide to start learning web development?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">always been interested in web design, in how and why a website looks as it does. Besides that, the gym&#8217;s webpage was partly managed by us, trainers, so I spent a lot of time writing and designing our WordPress blog, which I really enjoyed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I spotted a good opportunity on Facebook, where they advertised an online web develop</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> course. I looked it up, and I knew that I have to master the ins and outs of this profession on this platform&#8230; or at least the basics of it. It was the advertisement of CodeBerry.</span></p>
<p><b>How did you learn programming? What kind of courses, books etc. did you use?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After seeing the above-mentioned advertisement, I started to study at CodeBerry&#8217;s online course in September 2016, and later I added Codecademy and Udemy courses to my learning resources as well. I searched for and learned specific programming languages on video sharing sites.</span></p>
<p><b>What did CodeBerry offer you? What was it like to study at our school?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was very useful. I really liked your monthly subscription system, because this way I could study at my own pace. I loved the explanations, the examples through which the tasks are presented.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-6606 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Gabor_Baranyi_pic1.jpeg" alt="This is how a frontend developer’s desk looks like" width="760" height="427" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Gabor_Baranyi_pic1.jpeg 760w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Gabor_Baranyi_pic1-300x169.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gábor’s Desk</span></p>
<p><b>Do you have any experience, tips or tricks to share with those who are just starting their studies?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I find it very important to learn the basics well and to revise the earlier lessons to see the connections </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and to be able to put the new material in context. Revision is crucial.</span></p>
<p><b>Tell me a little about where you work now, what your duties are. What do you do on a typical day or week?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, I work at a Budapest based company&#8217;s office in Szeged. We are developing an internal project where I deal with the frontend, consisting of <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/a-brief-introduction-to-web-development/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I arrive at the office around 8 a.m. and I leave at 5 p.m. I try to do something different when I am not there; training or holding group training, so I can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">face the next working day energized and refreshed.</span></p>
<p><b>Who do you work with, and how do they help your work?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are currently about 20 people working in the office. I have a mentor helping me with my progress, who also supervises the project we are working on.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12018 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><b>What kind of software, tools or technologies do you work with currently?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The development environment is IntelliJ, for version control we use SourceTree and for repo, we use BitBucket.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the project, we use HTML, CSS (SCSS), jQuery, Angular JS, Angular Material and FUSE.</span></p>
<p><b>How long were you looking for a job? Was it hard to find a place to work?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actually, I was still studying when my friend suggest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ed that I s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">end my CV to the company he works for. They invited me for an int</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">erview, and a few weeks later they called me saying that they would like to work with me, based on my performance.</span></p>
<p><b>How was the interview process?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a brief introduction of the company, the interview continued in English, and it was my turn to introduce myself, talk a bit about my private life and about how and where I learned programming, also in English.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was followed by a technical part, where they assessed my knowledge and gave me a few logic tests to solve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The whole interview took about an hour.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12255 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><b>Do you have any advice for those who are currently preparing for a job interview?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is very important that everything you say has to be positive. Even if something negative comes up, try to talk about it from a positive aspect or perspective. Always stay confident, and show that you are able and willing to improve in any field.</span></p>
<p><b>What is the next step for you? What direction are you taking?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want to know as much about frontend development as possible and get a taste of backend development as well to see and understand the whole background process.</span></p>

<h3><b>What is programming?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose that you work for a multinational company and you have an upcoming meeting with a businessman from China. Your native language is [insert local language] and you don’t speak a word of Chinese. However, you remember that your second language is English and that the Chinese businessman speaks English as well. You then begin to use English as a common language to negotiate and communicate with each other. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12017 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3><b>What language do computers speak?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A computer’s native language is binary: an incredibly long list of 1’s and 0’s. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Binary</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> isn’t very easy for people to read or write, so we came up with programming languages to talk with computers, instead. Since computers don’t know human languages, we have to meet in the middle somewhere. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, unlike humans, computers aren’t able to pick up on indirect communication and always take things very literally. If you tell them something, they will do it exactly as they are told. Computers aren’t smart enough to make decisions on their own and won’t understand information that isn’t spelt out for them. For this reason, you need to make sure that you’re giving them exact instructions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if I told you to make a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sandwich</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you might ask me what ingredients I want on that sandwich and if I want it toasted or not. To you, that might be all you need to know to make me a delicious sandwich. However, there are many small decisions and previous knowledge involved in making a sandwich. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you simply tell a computer that you want a toasted ham and cheese sandwich with rye bread and mayonnaise, you might get something very different from what you ordered. A human would know that the mayonnaise goes on the slices of bread first, the ham and cheese are added second, then the sandwich is placed in the oven to be toasted. </span></p>
<h3><b>But, how is a computer supposed to know all</b> that?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember that we told the computer that we want, “a toasted ham and cheese sandwich with rye bread and mayonnaise.” To a computer, it might be logical to do all of those things in order. It would toast the ham and cheese by themselves, put two slices of rye bread on top, and then spread mayonnaise on the bread. </span></p>
<h3>Aren’t computers supposed to be smarter than that?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, because the computer takes things</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> literally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you have to specify the order of each step and the placement of each ingredient. Everyone knows that the ingredients go between the pieces of bread, but a computer has no previous knowledge of what a sandwich is like—it’s just following your direct instructions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is another reason why we can’t communicate with computers using human languages, just yet. Our languages are simply too ambiguous and too vague for a computer to understand properly. Also, if a word or a sentence might have a double meaning, a computer wouldn’t know how to interpret it. It needs everything spelt out for it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The truth is that computers aren’t smart at all; they just happen to process information faster than us. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6210" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/code.2-1.jpg" alt="" width="5472" height="3648" /></p>
<h3>What is a programmer and what do they do?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember, you can’t just tell the computer in English what you want. You’ll need a computer programmer to translate for you. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A computer programmer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a person who communicates your ideas and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">instructions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to a computer, making websites, games, and other programs appear on the screen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A programmer could also be defined as a polyglot (one who knows many languages) that specializes in talking to computers. They know exactly what to say and how to say it so that the computer will understand them. If you’ve ever learned another language, you know that each language comes with its own vocabulary, grammar, and set of rules. Computer languages also come with their own way of saying things, called syntax. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a person might understand you if you </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mispronounce</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a word, use the wrong conjugation, or mess up your grammar, a computer is a lot less forgiving with mistakes. As soon as you make a syntax error, the computer will stop listening to you and quit running the program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How rude. </span></p>
<h3>What are you able to accomplish with coding skills?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve ever used a computer, watched videos online, or played video games, it might be hard to believe that all of that comes from just a series of letters and symbols. The ability to process thousands of lines of code per second is the strength of a computer and allows it to follow highly complex instructions and accomplish incredible tasks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s take a look at some of the cool things you can do with code:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create &amp; Design Websites</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Build Mobile Apps</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Develop Desktop Programs</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Develop Video Games</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create &amp; Maintain Databases</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automate Tasks</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solve Complex Problems</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create Artificial Intelligence</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perform Statistical Analysis</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And much more&#8230;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re interested in any of these activities and would like to do them for a living, learning to program is definitely an important skill to have. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12028 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3>What makes coding useful and what is it good for?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we rely more and more on computers in our daily lives, the importance of computer programming and coding continues to grow as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the coming years, nearly all fields will involve computer programming and learning to code will give you an edge in your future career. For example, you can use programming skills in the areas of writing, analysis, management, engineering, software development, and so much more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advocates of programming see learning to code as a universal skill that everyone should have, such as the ability to read and write or perform simple mathematical equations. Many governments around the world believe this as well and have proposed initiatives to teach coding to kids alongside core curriculum in schools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like us, they see coding as the key to staying competitive in a global marketplace. </span></p>
<h3>I already know it’s useful, but what is programming actually like?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average day in the life of a programmer isn’t as glamorous as it might appear in movies or on television shows. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being a programmer requires a lot of concentration, patience, and a self-driven attitude. If you aren’t able to sit down and focus for hours at a time, you might want to reconsider pursuing a career in computer programming. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some programming jobs may require you to work on an irregular schedule and be available to fix bugs and solve problems immediately as they appear. Others may have you work from nine to five o’clock, just like a regular job. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, working as a computer programmer might give you more freedom than your current job allows. A good number of programming jobs are remote, meaning that you can code while at home, at a café, or while you get a tan at the beach—given that the wifi signal reaches that far. </span></p>
<h3>Is programming really right for me?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where the rubber meets the road and where you’ll have to seriously weigh the computer programmer pros and cons. Perhaps, you’ve had an unrealistic idea of what programming is like and haven’t considered that coding is just like any other job out there—it’s still hard work. However, if you meet the following criteria, chances are that you’ll love every second of it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Signs that Programming Isn’t Right for You:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are only motivated by money and aren’t interested in computers at all</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t like to sit down for long periods of time</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your eyes glaze over when you look at a page of code</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are relatively slow at typing and often make many typos</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Signs that Programming IS Right For You:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You describe yourself as both analytical AND creative</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have high attention to detail</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are comfortable working with others and working alone</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have a good basis for understanding written English</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You love problem-solving</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You love to always learn new things</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You adapt well to change</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You like to organize information and automate processes</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>What programming languages do I choose and where do I start?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s go back to the example of our meeting with the Chinese businessman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although English may be useful in a business setting, you might find that you need to learn other languages for different fields. For example, you might want to know French for diplomacy, Greek for philosophy, and German in the field of engineering. Depending on what field you work in, you will choose a specific language to meet your needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You won’t have the time or ability to learn every programming language out there, so you’ll need to be strategic about what languages you will learn. First, you need to determine what your focus is and what languages you need to know to accomplish your personal goals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While technically not programming languages, HTML and CSS are great languages to start with to begin learning the fundamentals of how programming works. HTML and CSS are “text markup languages” which are actually languages that we use to format and organize the text. Without HTML or CSS, your browser wouldn’t know if these words I’m writing are a headline, a paragraph, or a footer. It also wouldn’t know if these words should be bolded, italicized, etc. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even as I write this article, I am using HTML and CSS to help you and your internet browser understand what I have to say. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12019 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3>TL;DR (Too Long; Didn’t Read)</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In summary, programming is a high-paying career that requires patience, dedication, and extremely high attention to detail. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you hate sitting down at a computer and aren’t willing to put in the time to practice, you’ll likely hate programming and give up rather quickly. You also won’t do well if you are motivated by the paycheck and have no interest in the job itself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if you love learning new things, are self-motivated, and have a can-do attitude, you’ll succeed—regardless of your educational background.</span></p>

We had a chat with Attila about how he got here, what he learned about programming, and the difficulties of finding a job as a junior developer. </span></p>
<h3><strong>When someone asked about your profession a few months ago, how did you answer? </strong></h3>
<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;I used to say my job is networking at IT Services, meaning that I helped big companies join the internet. Our task spread from assuring the router arrived at the customer to actually making it work.&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:384,&quot;10&quot;:1,&quot;11&quot;:3}">I used to say my job is networking at <a href="https://www.it-services.hu/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">IT Services,</a> meaning that I helped big companies join the internet. Our task spread from assuring the router arrived at the customer to actually making it work. </span></p>
<h3><strong>And what is your answer now?</strong></h3>
<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;I’m a frontend UI developer at EPAM. I work in a bigger team, developing an application relying mainly on frontend technologies and designing the user interface. I use HTML, CSS and JavaScript on a daily basis.&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:384,&quot;10&quot;:1,&quot;11&quot;:3}">I’m a frontend UI developer at <a href="https://www.epam.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">EPAM</a>.

<h3><strong>That sounds great! So, programming wasn’t really a new task for you, was it? Did you encounter coding earlier?</strong></h3>
<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;I’m a frontend UI developer at EPAM. I work in a bigger team, developing an application relying mainly on frontend technologies and designing the user interface. I use HTML, CSS and JavaScript on a daily basis.&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:384,&quot;10&quot;:1,&quot;11&quot;:3}">Yes, I actually started using HTML and CSS during elementary school. Later in high school, we used Python all the time, relying on an antique book. I had to quit doing it because the libraries cited by the author didn’t exist anymore, so the tasks were unsolvable. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></p>
<h3><strong>Where did the idea of web development come from? </strong></h3>
<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;I’m a frontend UI developer at EPAM. I work in a bigger team, developing an application relying mainly on frontend technologies and designing the user interface. I use HTML, CSS and JavaScript on a daily basis.&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:384,&quot;10&quot;:1,&quot;11&quot;:3}">During my senior year of high school, two guys approached me, saying they needed web developers for their startup. Back then I had no clue about what I was about to dive into, but I said yes and I soon got the hang of it. Eventually, we finished the project, but web development had caught my attention, so I continued learning it on my own. Finally, I ran into a dead-end in spring, when I felt I can’t go on alone, I need a teacher. That’s when I found you. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </span></p>

<h3><strong>How long have you been studying with CodeBerry? </strong></h3>
<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;I’m a frontend UI developer at EPAM. I work in a bigger team, developing an application relying mainly on frontend technologies and designing the user interface. I use HTML, CSS and JavaScript on a daily basis.&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:384,&quot;10&quot;:1,&quot;11&quot;:3}">Since June 2016. </span></p>
<h3><strong>And how did you like it, what were the advantages? </strong></h3>
<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;I’m a frontend UI developer at EPAM. I work in a bigger team, developing an application relying mainly on frontend technologies and designing the user interface. I use HTML, CSS and JavaScript on a daily basis.&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:384,&quot;10&quot;:1,&quot;11&quot;:3}">To be honest, there wasn&#8217;t a tremendous amount of new information, but the course was great for recollecting my knowledge. The mentors helped me a lot – that was probably one of the best things in it. Having someone to discuss your problems with is a huge advantage. </span></p>

<p>That’s good to hear. Now it’s the beginning of autumn, that means you’ve gained enough knowledge in 3 months to find a job.</p>

Two weeks later EPAM contacted me. I was going to create a portfolio before contemplating looking for a job, but EPAM was faster. They invited me to an interview right away. </span></p>
<h3><strong>I wanted to ask you if the search was difficult, but I guess we can skip this question. </strong></h3>

<h3><strong>What is the next step for you? What direction are you taking? </strong></h3>

It’s also a huge dream of mine to teach programming in some form. Giving lectures or taking part in some more specific program, I don’t know yet, nor do I know how it’s going to happen, but I’m sure it will happen somehow. </span></p>
<h3><strong>As a well-experienced student, do you have any tips for those just starting to code? </strong></h3>
<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;I’m a frontend UI developer at EPAM.

I use HTML, CSS and JavaScript on a daily basis.&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:384,&quot;10&quot;:1,&quot;11&quot;:3}">I think it’s important to understand that the learning process can’t really be accelerated. Programming is a big challenge, not easy in the beginning. But once you’ve got the hang of it and understand the logic, it all becomes clear. From that point onwards everything speeds up. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </span></p>
