										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you want to learn one of the most popular programming languages that make finding a job a child&#8217;s play? Do you want employers to chase after you with the best jobs?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get a firm grasp of one (or more) of the programming languages below, and if your knowledge stands on firm grounds, we bet you will find a job quickly, and your programming skills will be compensated with a high salary.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the most popular programming languages?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world of technology is ever-changing, so the list of the most popular programming languages changes too:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are languages that seem like they can never be removed from the top 10 (e.g., Java, Python, JavaScript, SQL). </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, we noticed some trends in popularity—some technologies are used less and less (e.g., PHP) while others are used more widely (e.g., JavaScript).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They are also always creating new languages and technologies to solve the tasks of a particular area even more efficiently (e.g., R).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ones higher on the list of the most popular programming languages are general-purpose languages with a long history (like Java), but there are newer ones on the top 10 list as well, that have been developed for more special purposes (like R and MATLAB).</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we based our list on the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summaries of international trends: </span><a href="https://go.courses/blog/all-the-programming-languages-worth-learning-in-2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go Courses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://medium.com/@satyanageshan8/the-7-most-used-programming-languages-in-2019-and-2020-predictions-29c715c3f456" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">medium.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://hackr.io/blog/best-programming-languages-to-learn-2020-jobs-future" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hackr.io</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stackoverflow Developer Survey</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also looked at job-posting websites to see how many ads contain the programming languages below. In our article, we used the numbers of the website </span><a href="https://hu.indeed.com/jobs?q=java&amp;l=Hungary" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, since that is a meta job-posting site, meaning they compile the jobs from many other job sites. The numbers were accurate during the writing of this article, but job offers always change somewhat, of course.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Java</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Write Once, Run Anywhere”. This is what gives Java its popularity since programs written in this language can be run on any compatible device without recompiling them if Java has been installed. It is a general-purpose language that has versatile uses, like website development, or creating mobile and desktop applications. There are other Java versions available for corporate servers and other business applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also have to mention that Android is Java-based, there are many Java applications for Windows, and the corporate world and back-end programming also build heavily on this language, adding to the wide variety of job options.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 1038 Java-based programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article.</span></p>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Python</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is an easily readable, general-purpose language with an easy syntax. We can recommend this to beginners as well since Python is one of the most suitable programming languages to start learning the basics of programming. It stands on or near the top of the lists of the most popular, the most well-liked by programmers, and the easiest to learn programming languages, and has been on top for years now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine learning and AI development are the fastest developing areas of use for Python. It is also the most often used language in data science, but it isn’t unknown in the world of web programming and game development either.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 740 Python programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article.</span></p>

</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">JavaScript </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is mostly a language of websites. It is used primarily for front-end development, as this language makes most websites more interactive and dynamic, but it is starting to gain popularity on the server-side as well, with the help of the software system Node.js.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All steps of web development, and prior to that, UI and UX design (meaning the creation of user-friendly, good-looking and modern websites) have a great value on the labour market—we always need web developers. You can’t go wrong with this knowledge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 651 JavaScript programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article. </span></p>

</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">One step forward: TypeScript </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TypeScript is a scripting language created by Microsoft. The goal of developing it wasn’t the creation of another rival language, but making a tool that expands the possibilities of JavaScript so that we can do massive projects with it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 172 programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article that requires TypeScript skills or lists them as an advantage.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">C# </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With C#, we can create desktop, mobile, and web-based applications, and with the .NET framework makes it even easier to develop things for tools created by Microsoft and the Windows operating system. This framework has fused together with C# almost completely, they are usually mentioned together, and job offers generally require you to know the framework as well as the language.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are other software development platforms for C#, e.g., Unity, which has been created for game development and has since become the engine for many known games.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C# can also be suitable for writing websites and web applications using the ASP.NET framework.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C# can be used independently from Microsoft—you can write software for Xbox, Android, macOS and many more platforms.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 434 C# programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">SQL</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Structured Query Language is the standard language for data management. In our data-centric world, databases that store and process huge amounts of data are indispensable parts of our tools and services’ background processes. Experts who can create and manage databases like this are in high demand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning SQL is a worthy investment, and if you also have some other programming, data analysis, or data visualization skills, you can have a job basically anywhere since, as we have mentioned before, databases are needed everywhere.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 1300 programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article that requires SQL skills. </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12028 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">C++</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a low-level, close-to-hardware programming language that is hard to read and it is the upgraded version of the widely used C language, which is the basis for many systems. Learning this language requires strong IT and mathematical skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This language usually isn’t recommended for beginners, but this article is about programming languages that can help you find a job, and C++ certainly is one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can be used to create and fine-tune operating systems, device drivers, video games, and even desktop and mobile apps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are not a beginner, or if you are looking for long-term goals, C++ can be an amazing choice since C++ skills are valuable on the labour market. Corporations need highly-trained C++ developers who can complete especially complex and serious programming tasks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This valuable knowledge is compensated with a high salary, and senior C++ developers are among the most well-paid programmers. As newer and newer programming languages start to appear that are easier to use, the number of C++ developers are decreasing, so you are almost guaranteed a job if you are capable of working professionally in this complex language</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 362 C++ programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article.</span></p>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">PHP</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a scripting language used in web development and database management that is relatively easy to learn, and there are good and well-paid opportunities for it from the very beginning. It is popular and in high demand because one of the most popular website creation applications, WordPress, is running in PHP as well. In 2018, 83.5% of websites choose PHP as their server-side programming language, including such tech giants as Facebook, Tumblr or Slack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web developers, and more specifically, back-end or full-stack developers have many job options if they know and use PHP confidently.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 259 PHP programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">R</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">R is a field-specific programming language, used mostly for statistical analyses and the representation of their results. Nowadays, data science is a highly important and dynamically expanding area, so there are many job offers for writing statistical software and data analysis. R also plays a role in machine learning, which is also an important area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since statistical analysis is used in many fields—sciences and human research, commerce, marketing, and meteorology to name a few, R programming skills can be crucial for us not just as members of development teams, but for research groups and other things as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the infinite amount of data we are working within the 21st century, experts in data analysis and exploring correlations are becoming indispensable. So people can be sure that they will find positions in which they can make use of their R skills.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 187 programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article that mentions R.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perl</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previously, the most important language of the web had been Perl, also called “The Duct Tape of the Internet.” Today, other languages have gained considerable ground, but Perl is still a widely used general-purpose language.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They use Perl in system administration, programming networks, creating graphical user interfaces, and, of course, web development is also still on the table.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 129 Perl programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">MATLAB programming language</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lists of most popular programming languages are created using different criteria, but if we are looking at which languages are in high demand on the labour market, MatLab appears on more and more of them. MatLab is both the name of the development environment and the programming language used in that environment. It has been developed mostly for performing technical calculations, developing and testing algorithms, and creating simulations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is often used for a visual representation of scientific test results and data processing tasks. If you already have high mathematical skills or knowledge of some field of science, MatLab can become a valuable asset.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 76 MatLab programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swift </span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swift is a general-purpose, high-level programming language developed by Apple. It can be used to write programs for macOS, iOS or other Apple operating systems. It has many modern features that make development easier and more secure. It stands out from other programming languages for the same purpose in that programs are written in Swift run extremely quickly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The importance of Apple is unquestionable in the world of IT, so even if Swift isn’t one of the most popular programming languages yet, it is quickly rising, and you can already find a lot of jobs if you know it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 75 Swift programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nowadays, we don’t use the internet just for getting information, reading, watching videos and movies, or listening to music—we also shape the content by using social media, posting, commenting, chatting, using web applications, shopping in online stores, planning routes, and so on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Complex development teams work together to operate the many functions above—different members are responsible for different areas, and they are using various technologies and programming languages to achieve this. At a well-chosen web development course, you can learn all the know-how of this segment.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12017 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main areas of web development</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Web development is usually separated into two big areas (front-end and back-end),</strong> and there’s another term for people who have <strong>comprehensive knowledge of both areas (full stack).</strong> In this article, we collected courses that can help you learn about these areas of web development and acquire the skills necessary to work in these fields.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Front-end</span></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/326514/pexels-photo-326514.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;dpr=2&amp;h=750&amp;w=1260" alt="web development courses" width="503" height="336" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the areas of web development is front-end development, i.e., the <strong>creation and maintenance of interfaces seen by the user.</strong> Client-side programming means creating and maintaining dynamic and responsive websites using plans from graphic artists and designers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a front-end developer, <strong>you have to be familiar with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</strong> In addition, it is also useful to know <strong>frameworks and libraries like Angular, jQuery, or React.</strong></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back-end</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another web development area we usually talk about separately is back-end development which means <strong>server-side programming and maintenance</strong>. Back-end developers create background processes and build communication with databases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some often-used server-side programming languages:<strong> Java, PHP, SQL, Python, Ruby, Node.js, ASP.NET. </strong></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full-stack</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are <strong>IT specialists that are familiar with both back-end and front-end development</strong>, i.e., they understand the whole web development process. Both background processes and the maintenance of user interfaces require complex knowledge, therefore front-end, back-end, and full-stack developers are all sought-after on the labour market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can read more about </span><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/introduction-to-web-development/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the basics of web development</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if you need more information.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web development courses</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are interested in this area and would like to work as a web developer, <strong>you should apply to a course</strong> you like and start learning web languages. The courses listed in this post have different goals, so they teach different technologies. In time, it will become important to make clear what you want to do so that you can learn things accordingly.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. </span><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/hu/weboldal-keszites-tanfolyam/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CodeBerry &#8211; Website Creation Course </span></a><i></i></h3>
<ul>
<li><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">19.990 Ft/month</span></i></li>

<li><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online, with mentorship</span></i></li>
<li><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">From beginner level</span></i></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can learn the<strong> basics of HTML, CSS3,</strong> and the use of online and offline editors during the course. After successfully completing it, you will be able to create modern websites by yourself. The course is online, and <strong>experienced mentors help you</strong> along the way if you get stuck. You can learn individually, and according to your schedule. <strong>No prior knowledge is required</strong>—just your interest and commitment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <strong>The course takes up 5 hours of your time per week,</strong> and you can create exciting new interfaces, e.g., the main page of a blog or the user interface of a chat app. You will get constant feedback on your work from the mentors so that your development becomes even faster.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I always wanted to know how I can create a great website since I had blogs, personal websites, journals, yet I could never make them my own through formatting. I had minimal HTML knowledge when I started the Website Creation module, and it is incredible how much I learned from it even on the first day. I am grateful for the opportunity to access these fantastic lessons anytime, anywhere, with completely understandable materials at a reasonable price.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” &#8211; Attila Szabó (Facebook)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides <strong>detached programming courses,</strong> Lynda.com offers <strong>complete learning paths.</strong> If you’d like to start studying and have long-term plans to improve your skills, but some extra guidelines would be helpful, you can choose this option. In this case, you don’t have to worry about creating learning plans and search fitting courses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have already found your favourite course, <strong>you have the opportunity to follow all of the content provided by the same author.</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your goal is just to get familiar with web development tools first, you can choose a <strong>single beginner course</strong>, but there are also <strong>specializations</strong> which are useful if you already code and need some extra knowledge for a project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pluralsight has a <strong>monthly fee to use,</strong> but there are other options as well, like <strong>annual billing and premium access,</strong> which provides you with more <strong>interactive content and extended materials.</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>János Farkas</strong> is a construction technician, an applied graphic artist and a baker by profession.<br />
He has been working as a junior frontend developer at Y-collective (a Hungarian company) since January.</p>
<p><strong>In this episode of <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/category/codeberry-student-stories/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Student Stories</a>, let us take you on a follow-up journey</strong> with a former CodeBerry Programming School student.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I live here</strong>: Pécs, Hungary</p>
<p><strong>I work here</strong>: <a href="https://y-collective.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Y-collective</a></p>
<p><strong>I studied at CodeBerry for this long</strong>: 2 months</p>
<p><strong>I use</strong>: PHPStorm, Stack Overflow, CSS-tricks, W3Schools</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>When you&#8217;re asked about your profession, how do you answer?</strong></h3>
<p>First of all, I say that I am a programmer, usually everyone understands this.<br />
In most cases, people are interested when I tell them my profession. So, I give more details by explaining that I prepare the user interface of web pages visible to users.<br />
Sometimes I work on server-side scripting too&#8230;</p>
<h3><strong>What did you do for a living before you switched to web development?</strong></h3>
<p>This is the first time I work as a website developer. However, I started to get familiar with this field much earlier.<br />
I&#8217;ve been interested in this field for the past 10 years, but I only started taking it seriously last year.<br />
So far I only created some smaller websites (and I would do these in a different way now <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ).<br />
As for my previous jobs, I worked in the trading sector for 10 years.<br />
As the manager of the bakery department of a 7000 square meter superstore, my task was to supervise production, procurement, schedules and anything related.<br />
So, it was quite a big change for me.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>Why did you decide to start studying web development?</strong></h3>
<p>I have always been fascinated by the software part of computer science.<br />
Each year, the internet and web-related technologies play a greater and greater role in our everyday life.<br />
This results in an urging need for more and more professional developers. I would like to take this chance. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h3><strong>Tell me a little about where you work now, what your duties are. What do you do on a typical day or week?</strong></h3>
<p>I work as a junior site builder at Y-collective. Our office is in downtown Pécs.<br />
At the beginning of the week, there is a project management meeting where the tasks are determined and assigned. So it is more or less clear what everyone is going to work on during the week and maybe the following week.<br />
We have a lot of projects, so we have quite a variety of tasks.<br />
And it may happen that some urgent matter or a bug comes up on an ad hoc basis.<br />
My days usually start around 6 a.m., with a coffee.<br />
While drinking it, I glance over the news or I read about something I was dealing with the previous day.<br />
I usually go to work by bike. The official working hours are from eight in the morning to four in the afternoon, plus at times I stay a half-hour or an hour longer.<br />
Besides developments we do changes, bug fixes, importing existing modules to other projects, administrative duties, database modification&#8230;<br />
We recently started to concentrate more on unique WordPress developments.<br />
At times it needs some research or a plugin change, so it&#8217;s not boring.<br />
What I use daily is PHP, HTML, CSS, SCSS/LESS, Javascript/jQuery, Node/Bower, Bootstrap, and git.<br />
There are weekly/biweekly internal training and meetups on some subject.</p>

<h3><strong>How long were you looking for a job? Was it hard to find a place to work?</strong></h3>
<p>After all, I wasn&#8217;t looking for a job for long. Or rather, I did not expect to be able to enter the world of IT within such a short period of time.<br />
<a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/im-adam-freisinger-the-founder-of-codeberry-and-this-is-how-i-work/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Adam Freisinger</a>, one of the mentors at CodeBerry asked me about my professional goals, as I was making good progress with the materials.<br />
I didn&#8217;t keep it a secret that I intended to work in this field, so he organized an interview for me, then I got a trial task, and later a job.<br />
Hereby I&#8217;d like to thank everyone for the support, I&#8217;ll do my best to make up for it <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h3><strong>How did you learn programming? What kind of courses, books etc. did you use?</strong></h3>
<p>At first, I researched online materials, read articles and did tutorials.<br />
Then there was even more self-studying and then the next step was CodeBerry.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12018 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>What did CodeBerry offer you? What was it like to study at our school?</strong></h3>
<p>I was looking for an online course that could help me get to the next level. But for various reasons, none of them seemed really good.<br />
Then I stumbled upon CodeBerry.<br />
I really liked the approach: they not only realized that individuals need this course, but also that the IT sector is in need of junior professionals.<br />
A symbiotic relationship is built from this approach, which serves everyone&#8217;s needs.<br />
Studying is completely personalized: everyone can progress at their own pace. If someone is stuck, help is available from the Slack community, and Amanda.<br />
I wouldn&#8217;t say that I found very many new pieces of information in the teaching material, but for me, it was very useful for revising, for filling in the gaps I had, for deepening my knowledge&#8230;<br />
Personally, the extra service CodeBerry provided me was that I could assess my knowledge quite well, so I was more confident to make the decision to try myself out.</p>
<h3><strong>Do you have any experience, tips or tricks to share with those who are just starting their studies?</strong></h3>
<p>Start a side project while studying. Give a solution to a real problem, no matter how small it may be.<br />
You can learn a lot this way.<br />
Feel free to copy a solution or parts of it, but plan your own version and analyze and understand the parts that are not obvious to you.<br />
Even the scope of your studies can be built on this.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12255 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>What is the next step for you? What direction are you taking?</strong></h3>
<p>First of all, I definitely want to deepen my knowledge and catch up with my colleagues.<br />
We have a very well-prepared and seasoned team. Everyone is really good at what they do, and I learn a lot from them every day.<br />
Then I want to reach my own limits, and then&#8230; we&#8217;ll see.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>András P. Tóth</strong> studied computer science engineering at Budapest University of Technology and now works as a serial entrepreneur in the IT sector. He&#8217;s currently building <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">CodeBerry Programming School</a> with his friends. They hope to decrease the shortage of IT professionals in Hungary.</p>
<p>During the interview, Andris told us the story of his first [$110] salary and his first company sale as well as the cats of Instagram and the path lying in front of Hungarian developers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I live here</strong>: Budapest, Hungary.</p>
<p><strong>I work here</strong>: mostly at home, sometimes from internet cafés.</p>
<p><strong>I use</strong>: iPhone | MacBook Air | <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Sublime Text</a> | <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">bash</a> | PHP | <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Node.js</a> | <a href="https://mailchimp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Mailchimp</a> | Google</p>
<p><strong>My work style in a few words</strong>: small steps every day.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>When you&#8217;re asked about your profession, how do you answer?</h4>
<p>I usually say I build enterprises. If I see confusion, I add that I create enterprises in the IT sector. My job is to give other people jobs.</p>
<h4>Tell me more about what you do regarding programming?</h4>
<p>Normally I’m occupied by several different projects at once – some are for-profit (like CodeBerry Programming School), some are non-profit ones (e.g. Invisible University, <a href="http://yearcompass.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">YearCompass</a>). Sometimes, I just code to relax.</p>
<p>We started CodeBerry Programming School in 2016 with a few friends. We teach programming to people who’ve never done it before and help them find a job. Among other various tasks, I have plenty of things to do as a developer at this company:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m one of the code mentors who help students with technical things.</li>
<li>I write lots of code for our website as well as places where it connects to other software, like surveys, analytics and payment solutions.</li>
<li>I create modules for the system dealing with the programming homework, like admin statistics, badges, progression indicators.</li>
</ul>
<p>I relax by programming different little things I find interesting at that given moment. Some of my recent projects include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instagram script that gained followers for <a href="https://www.instagram.com/safranektheordinarycat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">our cat’s Instagram</a>.</li>
<li>Slack bot that creates photos of every teammate.</li>
<li>Temperature graph (with data collected by sensors).</li>
<li>Chrome plugin that shares the view of the webcam with another computer.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4></h4>
<h4>When, where and how did you learn to code?</h4>
<p>I was 10 years old when we got a C64 for Christmas. I learned programming with the help of books and friends. We had a little team captivated by the demoscene subculture, we all wanted to create art. We drew, composed music, programmed and, of course, competed with each other.</p>
<p>My first paid job was creating a webshop for an Italian company when I was sixteen. With the help of a dial-up internet connection, I would go online each night and attempt putting together a working website from code snippets I found on the internet. I was 18 when I applied to university where I studied computer science engineering.</p>
<p>In my third year, I started working as a developer and project manager. A year later I created my first company.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>How does your workspace look like?</h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>What are the job opportunities for web developers? On average, how much time did you spend looking for a job?</h4>
<p>I have never looked for a job before. Until the middle of my university studies, people always approached me with developer jobs and, after that, I always worked for my own company. I still get emails via LinkedIn every other week, asking if I’m interested in developer jobs, so I think the market is pretty open to us.</p>
<h4>What is your daily, weekly, yearly schedule like?</h4>
<p>Usually, I get up between 6:30 and 7:30 in the morning, depending on meetings. I work out, take a shower, have breakfast, and work until midday. I have lunch with someone, then work again until five, and then I try and relax.</p>
<p>Mostly, I work from home, so sometimes I doze off in the afternoon, but that results in late-night work. That is not good for anyone.</p>
<p>Most of the times I apply the Pomodoro technique to my work—25 minutes of work followed by a 5-minute rest filled with some chores.</p>
<p>We have operative discussions on Monday and strategic discussions every Tuesday morning. Tuesday to Thursday we all work from our home offices, and Friday we organize live or online meetings to summarize the week.</p>
<p>My job is rather diverse—a part of it is communication (insider conversations, outsider meetings, and code mentoring), a part of it is marketing (managing ads, writing copy, and getting marketing systems to work), and some of it is technical (all kinds of programming tasks).</p>
<p>Four times a year, I take a week off. I also have a few day trips with my colleagues twice a year.<br />
The Invisible University causes two weeks every six months to be rather packed (at the beginning and the end of each semester), and the YearCompass results in an intensive December and January. These make me accept fewer other jobs in these periods.</p>
<h4>What surprised you about this job that you never thought of before?</h4>
<p>Time flies when you program. I start solving a problem and two blinks later it’s already night time. This really surprised me first.</p>
<p>The other thing is the speed with which the whole programming knowledge evolves. I occupied myself with marketing for a few years and when I returned to programming, I could hardly understand what my colleagues were talking about.</p>
<p>It must have been a similar feeling to what elderly people experience when their children try to explain things they can’t catch up with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Do you have skills that would surprise everyday people?</h4>
<p>When somebody asks for help from us (e.g. “the internet is down” or “the printer doesn’t work”), we usually don’t know the solution right away either. All we do is patiently read the error message and find the answer on the internet.</p>
<h4>Who do you work with?</h4>
<p>I work alone a lot. We have weekly meetings, and chat each day with colleagues, if we work on tasks together. I also exchange emails with suppliers, partners, consultants, and the press frequently.</p>
<h4>What are the typical career paths in your profession?</h4>
<p>I think there are a few pronounced paths for IT professionals:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can choose the size and style of the company: freelancer, startup, small business, medium business, multinational and governmental companies.</li>
<li>You can choose a topic: operating, developing, planning, testing or even management, sales, support, growth, data, etc.</li>
<li>You’re distinct by your experience: entry-level, junior, senior, etc.<br />
and within each path, there are many specific junctions (e.g. a developer could be an Angular specialist front-end web developer)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can choose to navigate through these routes all through your life.</p>
<p>I see many examples among my friends too:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s popular to go from zero to infinite on the programming path.</li>
<li>There are plenty of “I started as an IT specialist but found out I was good with people, so I became manager” situations.</li>
<li>There are a few “I started at multinational companies, but I’m trying to build my own business”.</li>
<li>And few of my friends start off with running their own company in the first place.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What are your plans, how do you wish to continue?</h4>
<p>I’m over my first company sale (“Gyümölcstárhely”, a web hosting service was my first company, that was bought by one of Europe’s biggest hosting companies) and many failed projects too. So far, I really enjoyed this entrepreneur-developer combination, so it’s probably what I’m going to continue.</p>
<h4>What other profession would you choose if you had to change? Could you change?</h4>
<p>I wouldn’t change. I really enjoy teaching, so I can imagine doing some kind of consultant-trainer thing. I could probably change to a normal IT job and possibly marketing due to my entrepreneurship experience.</p>
<h4>What skills do great developers, IT experts require? Who do you not recommend this profession to?</h4>
<p>I find the following skills important:</p>
<ul>
<li>Engagement in details – it’s pretty difficult to code in a superficial style. You have to pay attention to the details.</li>
<li>The capability of concentration – finding a single error sometimes takes hours.</li>
<li>Proper English skills – if I’m stuck, I can only find help on the internet in English.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t recommend this profession if you don’t have these skills.</p>
<h4>What’s your favourite part?</h4>
<p>I love programs you can leave running for hours, days or weeks, doing something useful. Creating something that works is also a great feeling.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12255 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h4>What grinds your gears most? What are the difficulties and dangers of your profession?</h4>
<p>The &#8220;professional religious wars&#8221; are both annoying and entertaining. Seeing people fight over text editors and whether you should format code with tabs or spaces&#8230;</p>
<p>It’s not easy to keep up with the constantly changing technology—deciding on which program language to use or which new tool is good enough to be learned.</p>
<p>Plus, there are dangers in this profession:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sitting all day – you need some extra effort if you don’t want to end up being a fat geek.</li>
<li>The bubble – it’s easy to think a company packed with IT professionals are all well-paid 20-50-year old men who understand programming jokes.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How stable is your job? How much time does one spend working for the same company?</h4>
<p>I work in a startup. There are faster-changing projects, undeveloped processes, and bigger uncertainty compared to a bigger, well-functioning company. I worked for 5-6 years in my previous companies; we always started new ones after that.</p>
<p>I have never heard of an IT professional being fired among my friends. Some are more loyal and work decades at the same company, while others change every few years, motivated by higher wages and more interesting roles.</p>
<h4>If you had to ask for one thing in the name of all developers, what would it be?</h4>
<p>As an IT specialist, I would ask, please read the error messages and Google them before you call us.</p>
<p>As an entrepreneur, I wish for clear and understandable emails when seeking help after something goes wrong—what have they tried, what did they expect and what happened instead—and we’ll think of the solution together.</p>
<h4>How much can one earn in this profession (as a newbie, experienced and veteran)?</h4>
<p>In my experience as an entrepreneur:</p>
<ul>
<li>I didn’t make a penny during the first year. I only fed the project with my money.</li>
<li>The first month after the tipping point I could pay myself $110. Later my salary slowly grew to $15,000.</li>
<li>I gained a bigger amount by selling my company. Enough to cover all expenses in the next 4-5 years, letting me focus on my next project.</li>
</ul>
<p>My developer friends usually make more than that. Most of the time, they have a secrecy agreement, so we can only speak of approximates: they make $15,000-30,000 in Hungary, more as a leader, and well over $70,000 in the West. It’s worth browsing <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Glassdoor</a>; they have a lot of info about salaries.</p>
<h4>What do you think is the best way to learn to code?</h4>
<p>There are a lot of great online and offline courses. We collected these on a website: http://programozastanfolyam.com./</p>
<p>The following things helped me the most:</p>
<ul>
<li>Actually having to type the solution to a given task (instead of reading it in a book or watching a video about it)</li>
<li>Specific projects that I could finish (e.g. I’ll build a site for a friend or a project)</li>
<li>A friend or mentor who already knew how to code and could help me when I had problems.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What makes code worth learning?</h4>
<p>For me, programming:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lets me experience creating something.</li>
<li>Offers job opportunities and stable financial support.</li>
<li>Is relaxing.</li>
</ul>
