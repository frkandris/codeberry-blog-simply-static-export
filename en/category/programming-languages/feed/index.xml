										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Android software development and Android programming are terms that mean creating applications that run on devices with the Android operating system. In this article, we will look at the languages and tools needed for Android programming, and we’ll mention the current trends and means of learning it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Programming Languages Are Used to Develop Android Applications? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually, two languages are used to develop apps for Android—</span><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/hu/java-programozas-alapjai/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Java</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Kotlin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Java is one of the most popular and widely used languages with an enormous codebase, many accessible learning materials, and experienced programmers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are tutorials and sample solutions for many problems in Android programming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kotlin is a newer language, 16 years younger than Java. It has many advantages. For example, we can do the same thing in fewer lines of code, so there are fewer chances of making errors. However, it means there are fewer learning materials, forums, information, and it is harder to find real experts and developers with a lot of experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, most Android applications run in Java, and parts of the Android operating system were even written in Java, the rest being written in C++. With time, this emphasis on Java may shift because Google started supporting Kotlin.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><div style="width: 676px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" src="https://devathon.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/02/kotlin-vs-java-devathon.jpg" alt="" width="666" height="549" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Credit: <a href="https://devathon.com/blog/kotlin-vs-java-android-app-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Devathon</a></p></div></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reading the forums and blog posts about the topic, we can see that even though Kotlin is a popular language and will be important in the future of Android programming, Java is still crucial to learn if we want to create Android apps.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codinginflow.com/java-or-kotlin-android-beginner" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this blog post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the author collects forum comments and other opinions about Java vs. Kotlin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They emphasize that beginners who just started getting to know the basics of programming should use Java and try Kotlin later since that is fully compatible with the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) that runs Java.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Java is a better choice to learn the basic operations and structures of programming, say the comments in the article. Another argument for Java is that the number of open positions and job offers is many times greater than with Kotlin, as Java is used in other areas and not just Android development.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Android Programming in a Nutshell – Tools</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://developer.android.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Android Developers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the developer website of Android, is a good place to start since we can find a summary of Android’s programming processes and development tools there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the website, we can find an in-depth description of the operating system and its different versions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_12643" style="width: 1327px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12643" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12643 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1.png" alt="" width="1317" height="331" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1.png 1317w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-300x75.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-1024x257.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-768x193.png 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-1080x271.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1317px) 100vw, 1317px" /><p id="caption-attachment-12643" class="wp-caption-text">Credit: <a href="https://developer.android.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Android Developers</a></p></div></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are an experienced developer, looking through the </span><a href="https://developer.android.com/docs" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">documentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will probably answer most of your questions. If you are a beginner, you need to learn other things to make sense of all the concepts and procedures.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Android SDK and Android Studio</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google uses many of its own tools and libraries to help the work of developers, and these are all collected in the Android Software Development Toolkit (SDK). The modules in it contain different tools (</span><a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/build-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Build-Tools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Platform-Tools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Debug-Tool</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/emulator" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emulator</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> etc.). With the emulator, we can test how an app works and gets displayed on Android devices (cell phones, tablets etc.).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google released its own Integrated Development Environment. (IDE) for this called </span><a href="https://developer.android.com/studio" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Android Studio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There are many special tools built-in to Android Studio besides an editor. You can find more information about it in the </span><a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/intro" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">User Guide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Much Money Can I Make as an Android Developer? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an Android developer, you’ll earn more as a beginner than in the more saturated, general IT areas (e.g., front-end developers).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know Kotlin or software development with Java, you can get </span><b>a gross salary of $99.000 </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Credit: </span><a href="https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Skill=Kotlin_Programming_Language/Salary" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PayScale</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). If you already have finished projects you can present, or have a significant internship experience, you might even go over $100.000.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_12644" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12644" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12644 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/glassdoor-android-salary.png" alt="Average Android Developer Salaries, March 2021" width="990" height="286" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/glassdoor-android-salary.png 990w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/glassdoor-android-salary-300x87.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/glassdoor-android-salary-768x222.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" /><p id="caption-attachment-12644" class="wp-caption-text">Average Android Developer Salaries, March 2021 &#8211; Source: <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/android-developer-salary-SRCH_KO0,17.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Glassdoor</a></p></div></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the IT sector, you can become a senior developer relatively quickly—of course, you need to spend </span><b>3 to 5 years</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> working, learning and self-developing, challenging yourself along the way. After gaining this much experience, you can get </span><b>a gross salary of $110.000 &#8211; $125.000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> working for firms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you would like to take on more responsibility and have at least 5 years of relevant professional experience, you can even reach a dream salary. </span><b>As an expert Android developer</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can get a gross salary of </span><b>approximately $140.000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_12646" style="width: 685px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12646" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12646 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/android-jobs.png" alt="How much can you make as an Android developer?" width="675" height="526" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/android-jobs.png 675w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/android-jobs-300x234.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px" /><p id="caption-attachment-12646" class="wp-caption-text">How much can you make as an Android developer?

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All in all, Android development is an interesting, well-paying, and sought-after skill, so if you want to get to know the world of applications, it will be well worth it to familiarize yourself with this area.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Can I Learn Android Programming?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to learn Android development, you have to master a programming language (Java or Kotlin), the use of a toolkit (Android SDK), and learning the steps of design-implementation-testing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12028 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can learn all these individually, with the help of books and other materials, or learn them in courses. In this article, we will focus on Hungarian learning materials, but there are countless English tutorials, online courses, and textbooks available as well.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Individual Learning With the Help of Programming Videos</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you would like to watch Hungarian videos, you should look around on YouTube, but there is also an exciting course at WebUni.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Android Programming Courses</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many Android development courses online and offline if you don’t want to learn individually but with a team and a tutor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google published a free English programming course that makes you a real mobile app developer in about 2 months. This course teaches you Kotlin and the mindset needed for mobile app development. Here is the website of the course: </span><a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/developing-android-apps-with-kotlin--ud9012" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing Android Apps with Kotlin</span></a></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Long Does It Take to Learn Android Programming?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, just like with any other programming skill—or any other skill in general, how long it takes to learn Android programming depends on how many hours you put into it, what skills you already have, your motivation, learning methods, and your previous knowledge. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How long it takes to learn a language, technology, etc., is a frequently asked question, but it cannot be answered objectively when you consider the factors above. How long you practice, how much real, deep, and usable knowledge you can acquire is what matters. The first thing we need to know is our own learning style and the methods that are effective for us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you would still like to get an approximation of how much time you need to put into learning Android programming, and you start researching the topic, you will find the following information:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 3 to 6 months if you have previous programming knowledge, know one of the languages used for Android development, and therefore only need to learn the Android toolkit and its specialties. (Of course, it can take more or less time than this, even with previous knowledge.) Taking this time can result in us being able to create complex apps.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have prior knowledge, you can learn to create simple apps within a month.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who have never programmed before and have to start from the basics must first learn Java or Kotlin. This can take up to 3-6 months before we can begin programming for Android.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who choose courses instead of individual learning will find that in Hungary, these require you to have previous programming knowledge. They build on that to teach you the most important things about application development in 40 hours, within a month.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In summary, we can say that you can learn Android development within a year from the beginner level. The complexity of applications you can create will depend on the time and effort you put into mastering these skills.</span></p>

<li><strong>Beginner’s Guide to JavaScript</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JavaScript is the language of the web. Almost every site you visit in your web browser will be using it in some manner to enhance the user experience. This is why JavaScript is such a desirable component of the modern programmer’s toolkit. There really is no substitute for this flexible language if you want to create brilliant browser-based experiences capable of hooking in customers, clients, and prospective employers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want to create a website for your fast-growing socks-for-dogs business? Or how about an in-browser VR experience of what it’s like to visit your mother-in-law’s house at Christmas? You’ll have to learn JavaScript if you want to achieve these noble dreams and so much more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So if any of that takes your fancy (or you’re just bored on the toilet at work), read on to find out more about the basics of JavaScript and begin your journey towards becoming a web-programming ninja.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12017 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Variables</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A great place to start is with variables. Variables are where coders store information that a program needs whilst it is running. They’re like boxes that you can put stuff in. A programmer can create a variable in code, fill it with something, and then access it later. This way information can be available when it is needed.</span></p>
<h4><i>So, how do I create a variable in code?</i></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like this:</span></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code class="language-javascript" lang="javascript">var myCoolVariable;</code></pre>
<h4><em>What the hell does that mean?</em></h4>
<p>Glad you asked. The line above consists of two parts that come together to create a variable. Let’s break it down.</p>
<ul>
<li>var
<ul>
<li>In JavaScript, this is a reserved word. There’s quite a few of these in the language and they all have dedicated jobs. This one tells the program you’re about to <em>create a variable</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>myCoolVariable
<ul>
<li>This is the <em>variable</em> <em>identifier</em>, which is just its name. This could be anything, from ‘cat’ to ‘antidisestablishmentarianism’ (please don’t name your variables this). The variable identifier is used to <em>reference </em>the variable later when you need it. It is considered good practice to give your variables names that describe what they do. So if you have a variable to contain your age, then you should probably call it myAge. Do this consistently, and your fellow programmers will love you and buy you things.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><em>Okay, cool, but what next?</em></h4>
<p>Remember when I said variables are like boxes? Well, the code above creates the box, but we haven’t yet put anything inside it. This is the next step. But before that, a word on <em>data types</em>.</p>
<h4><em>Data who?</em></h4>
<p>Data types are the different kinds of variables you can create. Mostly all programming languages have these. Some are very strict about them. They make you state exactly what type of variable you’re creating from the get-go and then stick to that throughout. JavaScript isn’t like this. You can create a variable of a certain type in JavaScript and then change it later on a whim as variable values and types can be changed at any time. Woohoo. Go crazy.</p>
<p>Here are some of the data types available to JavaScript programmers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Number
<ul>
<li>The Number type defines a variable with a numeric value. This type of variable can theoretically store values from -Infinity to +Infinity. It can also store a special value, NaN, which means ‘Not a Number’ and happens when you’ve done something wrong and confused JavaScript. Poor JavaScript.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>String
<ul>
<li>The String type defines a variable that contains text, like ‘Hello’, ‘Goodbye’ or ‘Backstreet’s Back, Alright!’</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Boolean
<ul>
<li>The Boolean type defines a variable that can be either <em>true</em> or <em>false</em>. This type of variable is often used for making decisions in code. Should I stay or should I go? Booleans have the answer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other data types available and if you want to look into them, you can <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_datatypes.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">click here.</a> </p>
<h4><em>Giving Variables a Value</em></h4>
<p>Let’s look at how to put stuff into variables. The following is some code that does just that.</p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code class="language-javascript" lang="javascript">myCoolVariable = 10;
myCoolVariable = ‘hello’;
myCoolVariable = true;</code></pre>
<p>The image above shows some code that sets myCoolVariable three times: once to a Numeric value (10), to a String value (‘hello’) and then to a Boolean value (true).</p>
<h4><em>Creating and Setting a Variable at the Same Time</em></h4>
<p>It’s also possible to create and set a variable all at once. You do it like this:</p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code class="language-javascript" lang="javascript">var myCoolVariable = 10;</code></pre>
<p>Here we create myCoolVariable and give it the value 10 in one line. Check us out. Wonderful.</p>
<h4><em>Referencing a Variable Later</em></h4>
<p>Creating and setting variables is great. But the true power comes later when you actually use them. So what does that look like? It’s easy. Just use the identifier.</p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code class="language-javascript" lang="javascript">var myCoolVariable = 10;
var myCoolVariableDouble = myCoolVariable + myCoolVariable;</code></pre>
<p>Here we create myCoolVariable and give it the value 10. Then we create another variable, myCoolVariableDouble and set it to the result of adding myCoolVariable to itself. So now myCoolVariableDouble equals 20 and we have two variables in the program. Two! Get the camera, dad.</p>
<h4><em>Enough about Variables</em></h4>
<p>We’ve covered the basics of variables: creating them, setting them and referencing them. But there is so much more to programming in JavaScript than that. Now that we have this down, we can move on to bigger and better things. Like if statements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12018 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>If Statements</strong></h3>
<p>So we’ve got variables down, but how do we use them to do cool and awesome things? Well, one of the ways is by using if statements.</p>
<p>An &#8216;if statement&#8217; is a way in which a programmer can build <em>decision-based logic </em>into their code. This means that we can tell our programs to do something based on a certain <em>condition</em>. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code class="language-javascript" lang="javascript">If (10 &gt; 20) {
  // Run this code
} else {
  // Run this code
} </code></pre>
<figure class="wp-block-table">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>{}’s define a code block. Some JavaScript tools, like the if statement, require these in order to separate different bits of code.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</figure>
<p>Let’s break this down.</p>
<ul>
<li>if
<ul>
<li>This is another reserved word. It indicates to the program that the following code will be an if statement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(10 &gt; 20)
<ul>
<li>This part is the <em>condition</em>. The program will evaluate this and then choose what to do based on the result. A condition always outputs a Boolean value, i.e. true or false. If the output of the condition is true, the if statement will run the code block immediately after the closing bracket of the condition. If it evaluates to false, then the code in the else block will be run instead, which is exactly what happens here since 10 is not more than 20.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>else
<ul>
<li>This is another JavaScript keyword. It simply defines the code that should run if the <em>condition</em> evaluates to false. The else block is not required. If you add it, then you’re technically creating an if else statement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully, it is now clear why we need to use {} here. Without defining a code block, it wouldn’t be clear to the program which code should run if the condition evaluates to true or if it evaluates to false.</p>
<p>If statements are one of the core building blocks of complex programs. Mastering these is imperative to becoming a competent JavaScript programmer.</p>
<h3><strong>Loops</strong></h3>
<p>Loops are another important tool. As the name suggests, these run bits of code over and over again until a condition is met. There are a few different kinds of loops, but we’re only going to look at two here. I’ll provide links to further study.</p>
<h4><em>The For Loop</em></h4>
<p>We will look at the for loop first. Here’s an example.</p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code class="language-javascript" lang="javascript">var numberOfIterations = 10;
for (var i = 0; i &lt; numberOfIterations; i++) {
  // do something 10 times
}</code></pre>
<p>This might look a little weird compared to other stuff, but it becomes really straightforward when you break it down. I’ll go over each individual part.</p>
<ul>
<li>var numberOfIterations = 10
<ul>
<li>This is just the code for creating and setting a variable in one go.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>for (var i = 0; i &lt; numberOfIterations; i++)
<ul>
<li>for
<ul>
<li>Another reserved word. This tells the program you’re about to write a for loop.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>var i = 0
<ul>
<li>Creating and setting a variable again. This is a special case because we’re creating it within the for loop. This means that variable i will only exist for the duration of that for loop. Once it’s done executing, i will be discarded. Forever. Goodbye i.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>i &lt; numberOfIterations
<ul>
<li>This line tells the for loop to execute only while the variable i is less than the value of numberOfIterations (10).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>i++
<ul>
<li>Finally, this line tells the for loop that once it is done executing a single iteration, it should increase the value of i by 1.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope it’s now quite easy to see how the for loop works. It creates a temporary variable to track the number of loops it has done: (i), then it defines the condition for execution (only while i &lt; some value) and then it defines how i should increase with each loop (in this case, +1 but it can really be anything you want).</p>
<p>Evidently, the for loop is good when you know how many times you want to run something. But what about when you don’t? Here comes the while loop.</p>
<h4><em>The While Loop</em></h4>
<p>The while loop is simpler than the for loop. It just takes a condition and executes until that condition is false. Here’s an example.</p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code class="language-javascript" lang="javascript">var shouldKeepRunning = true;
while (shouldKeepRunning) {
  // Do some code
  shouldKeepRunning = false;
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>while
<ul>
<li>We’re telling the program we’re about to write a while loop.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(shouldKeepRunning)
<ul>
<li>This is the condition. The loop will run while the value of shouldKeepRunning is true. This is the same as writing shouldKeepRunning == true, but we can write it like this as shorthand.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<figure class="wp-block-table">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>JavaScript uses == to compare two values, as = is used to set a value. So if you write if (10 == 20), you’re really saying ‘if 10 is equal to 20’.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</figure>
<p>This loop will only run once as we immediately set shouldKeepRunning to false on the first iteration. It will probably be a little different in your code, but it’s important to make sure that the loop will stop at some point. We don’t want to cause a global catastrophe.</p>
<p>These are the only two loops we will go over here, but if you want to learn more, you can check out <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">this link</a>. </p>
<h3><strong>Functions</strong></h3>
<p>All the tools we’ve got right now are great for writing small, sequential scripts, but what if we want to write larger programs that make use of the same bits of code over and over? We don’t want to have to constantly copy and paste any code we want to reuse. This is where functions come in.</p>
<p>Functions are reusable chunks of code. Here’s an example.</p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code class="language-javascript" lang="javascript">function doSomething(argumentOne, argumentTwo) {
  // do something here
}</code></pre>
<p>Breaking this down, we get:</p>
<ul>
<li>function
<ul>
<li>Just another JavaScript keyword.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>doSomething
<ul>
<li>This is the <em>function identifier</em>. Just like a variable identifier, it lets us refer to this function later in code.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(argumentOne, argumentTwo)
<ul>
<li>The code within the brackets is the argument list. The two values argumentOne and argumentTwo behave as variables within the function and therefore can be used as such. We’ll see in a second how these variables get set.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Any code defined within the function block can be run as many times as you like simply by invoking the function. Here’s an example of that.</p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code class="language-javascript" lang="javascript">doSomething(10, 20);</code></pre>
<p>We use the function identifier doSomething and then we pass two arguments, 10 and 20. These arguments that we pass will then populate the arguments in the function’s argument list, argumentOne and argumentTwo. Order matters, so argumentOne will get the value 10, and argumentTwo will get the value 20.</p>
<p>Functions operate the same as variables in that you can only refer to a function within the block, and all child blocks, where it was defined. If you have a function that was created inside an if statement block, for example, then you can’t use it outside of that block.</p>
<p>Functions are extremely important tools if you want to create complex and dynamic programs, so they’re important to practice. For more information, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">see here.</a> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Uses for PHP programming</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re interested in becoming a web developer, you’ve undoubtedly heard of PHP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PHP is one of the most useful languages you can learn at the start of your Web Development career, as it’s relatively easy to learn and gives you access to plenty of great jobs from the very beginning. There’s also a high chance that your first projects and part-time gigs as a web developer will involve working with this scripting language. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the main reasons why there are so many opportunities for PHP developers is that WordPress, the web’s most popular website builder, runs on PHP. In fact, over 60 million websites on the internet use WordPress, as well as 30% of the top 10 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you were to learn PHP for the sole purpose of working with WordPress, you’d still end up getting an incredible return on investment. As a PHP developer, you’ll be able to develop and sell themes and plugins for WordPress, which is a great way to make some cash when you’re just starting out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, PHP goes far beyond WordPress; it’s used by a large number of online businesses. In 2018, 83.5% of websites used PHP as their server-side scripting language of choice, including tech giants like Facebook, Tumblr, and Slack.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, knowing PHP can really open up a lot of doors for you as a web developer. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12017 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What Is PHP programming?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This server-side scripting language is commonly used in the back-end for tasks such as managing data on servers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PHP was originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994, and originally stood for “Personal Home Page.” Now, the acronym stands for “Hypertext Preprocessor.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PHP can be embedded in HTML code and was created to manage Lerdorf’s personal webpage at the time. PHP was never actually designed, or even intended to be a programming language. Instead, it grew organically. This led to many inconsistencies in the language. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, many efforts have been made by the community to make PHP cleaner and more consistent—and they’ve been quite successful. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to having a large community and plenty of job opportunities, PHP is easy to learn and doesn’t require you to start from scratch. With so many available themes, plugins, and websites for WordPress, you can simply take some pre-existing code and edit it to create something new. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PHP is also extremely quick to set up on your computer and won’t take days like some other programming languages. As if it weren’t easy enough already, most web-hosting sites already have PHP installed on the server, making your job a total breeze. If you ever encounter problems in the future, there’s a large, active community on the internet and plenty of documentation available to help.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What Is Programming in PHP Like?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s what PHP looks like using the classic “Hello World” example:</span></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code class="language-php" lang="php">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;PHP Test&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;?php echo '&lt;p&gt;Hello World&lt;/p&gt;'; ?&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the PHP code is embedded within an HTML document. PHP doesn&#8217;t have to be contained within HTML, but it just happens to work well together. </p>
<p>Since it’s not necessary to embed PHP in HTML, we could also write the statement like this:</p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code class="language-php" lang="php">&lt;?='Hello world'; ?&gt;</code></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How Much Do PHP Programmers Make?</strong></p>
<p>According to data from indeed.com, PHP developers in the United States make an average of $87,686 per year, which is $7,307.17 per month before taxes and have worked in their current position for less than 1 year. This, of course, includes many salaries from expensive areas such as San Francisco and New York where salaries are inflated for cost of living.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How Do I Learn PHP?</strong></p>
<p>PHP is known as a beginner-friendly and easy-to-learn language. For this reason, many programmers choose to start with PHP immediately after learning languages like<a class="rank-math-link" href="https://codeberryschool.com/hu/#courses" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external"> HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</a>. That way, they can start in back-end Web Development while they’re already making money and gaining front-end development experience. </p>
<p>If you’d like to learn PHP, there are a few steps you’ll want to take:</p>
<p>The first step is to sign up for a good online course or coding bootcamp that will teach you PHP. As it is rather simple to read and understand in comparison with other programming languages, one can easily learn PHP without having had a formal education.</p>
<p>The second step to learning PHP is finding good print and digital resources you can study in your free time. There are plenty of books and manuals available out there that can teach you how to program in PHP, as well as <a class="rank-math-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=te3GnuhU6oQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">online videos and tutorials</a>. Because PHP has been around for such a long time, you might even find some good books on PHP programming at your local library.</p>
<p>The third step is to seek out <a class="rank-math-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PHPhelp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">online communities</a>, forums, and message boards where you can get help from more experienced PHP programmers. Continue to practice and ask the community whenever you get stuck and can’t figure out a solution yourself. Both Slack and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PHPhelp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Reddit</a> have communities where PHP programmers actively discuss related topics and answer questions.</p>
<p><strong>How Long Does it Take to Learn PHP?</strong></p>
<p>The amount of time it <a class="rank-math-link" href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/how-long-it-takes-to-learn-to-code/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">takes to learn a programming language</a> depends on the methods you use, your learning retention, and how many hours you invest per week. It also depends on how you define “knowing how to code.” However, due to its incredible simplicity, you can expect to learn the essentials of PHP in a surprisingly short amount of time.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t have any previous programming experience, you can probably expect to spend anywhere from a few days to a couple of weeks to achieve a working knowledge of PHP. Learning the additional features and getting comfortable enough with PHP to become a professional developer will probably take around 3 months.</p>

<p><strong>Is PHP Right for Me?</strong></p>
<p>To determine if a programming language is right for you, you first need to figure out how it lines up with your long-term goals. </p>
<p>Learning PHP is a great place for beginners to start. It allows you to get involved in back-end development and start receiving a return on your investment in the shortest amount of time. </p>
<p>However, nowadays PHP is mostly limited to WordPress, and in order to achieve maximum employability, we recommend beginners start with more popular languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Learning these three languages will allow you to become a more versatile and well-rounded programmer.</p>
<p>To learn if PHP is a good fit for you, please check out our article, “<a class="rank-math-link" href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/which-programming-language-is-right-for-you/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Which Programming Language is Right for Me?</a>”. There, you’ll learn about a variety of other programming languages and what you can do with them.</p>

<h2>What Is Python?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that was designed to be extremely easy to read and understand. “High-level” means that Python is closer to human languages than other programming languages. Python has a vibrant and active community and by learning this language you’ll have access to the many great tools created by Python contributors since its creation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/python-programming-course-for-beginners" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12196 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Python-1-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Python-1-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Python-1-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Python-1-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What Is Programming in Python Like?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The philosophy of Python can be found in a document named, “</span><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Zen of Python</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">”. According to this document, Python is based on the following design principles:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beautiful is better than ugly</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explicit is better than implicit</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simple is better than complex</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Complex is better than complicated</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Readability counts</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And more&#8230;</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Python is capable of accomplishing various tasks with the use of add-ons. Thanks to the vast number of specialized libraries for Python, this general-purpose language can be repurposed to do an incredible amount of things. For example, specialized libraries allow programmers to use Python in rather technical fields, such as Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, and Statistics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As well as learning the basics of Python, you’ll want to learn how to navigate certain libraries that correspond to your specific field. Just like JavaScript, learning how to use specific libraries and frameworks will be a key part of your ongoing education. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Uses for Python</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Python is considered by many to be the “swiss army knife” of programming languages and it continues to fill this role with a growing number of specialized libraries and frameworks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you visit </span><a href="https://www.python.org/about/apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Python</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you’ll find a list of Python programs, as well as the corresponding libraries and frameworks for each. Some of these applications include Web Development, Scientific and Numeric, Education, Desktop GUIs, Software Development, and Business Applications. Python is also one of the leading programming languages for Artificial Intelligence, thanks to the popular TensorFlow framework developed by Google’s AI division. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How Much Do Python Programmers Make?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As discussed in our previous articles, location plays a big part in how much you make as a programmer. According to </span><a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/python-developer-salary-SRCH_KO0,16.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glassdoor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Python programmers in the US can expect to make around $92,000 per year, making it one of the top-paid languages. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/python-programming-course-for-beginners" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12028 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How Do I Learn Python?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to the popularity of Python and its relatively old age (27 years old), Python programming language has plenty of educational resources available for new learners. If you prefer a more traditional method of learning, university courses are a great choice for you. Coding bootcamps and online courses, on the other hand, are geared towards quick, self-motivated learners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’d like to read more about the various options you have for learning programming, check out our article, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“<a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/how-to-learn-to-code/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">How to Learn to Code</a>”. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How Long Does it Take to Learn Python?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The amount of time it takes to learn a programming language depends on the methods you use, your learning retention, and how many hours you invest per week. You can’t expect to know everything about Python after taking a semester-long course at your local university or a 14-week program at a coding bootcamp. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the basics, you’ll need to spend lots of time learning how to use various frameworks and libraries. Some of the most notable frameworks for Python are Django and Web2Py. Just like with JavaScript, becoming a Python “expert” includes knowing a lot about the various frameworks that have been developed over the years. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Is Python Right for Me?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To determine if a programming language is right for you, you need to figure out how it lines up with your long-term goals. Python is useful for a huge variety of tasks, making it a good starting point for any programmer. However, if you’re set on becoming a web developer, for example, you shouldn’t invest much time in learning Python. Instead, your focus should be directed towards HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To learn if Python is a good fit for you, please check out our article, “<a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/which-programming-language-is-right-for-you/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Which Programming Language is Right for Me?</a>”. There, you’ll learn about a variety of other programming languages and what you can do with them.</span></p>

<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congratulations on taking your first steps toward becoming a web developer.  </span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ve just made a very wise decision that will drastically improve your life in many new and exciting ways. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The skills you’ll learn in web development will not only open doors for you in your current career, but will help you to achieve the personal and financial goals that you once thought were unreachable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you pursue this new profession, you’ll find yourself asking a lot of questions and seeking out information to guide you along the right path. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why we created this guide: to help you obtain the knowledge and experience you need to achieve your dreams of becoming a web developer, in the shortest amount of time possible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, before you decide to completely dedicate yourself to learning this valuable craft, we think that you should know as much as you can about web development in order to determine if it’s truly a good fit for you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ll do our best to answer any additional questions you may have, as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this first article, we’ll begin by explaining the fundamentals of web development and what a web programmer’s day looks like. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, let’s get started.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12017 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h2>What Is Web Development? (Front-End and Back-End)</h2>
<p>Web development, or web programming, is a general term for the processes and skills required to create websites and web applications.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Examples of web apps include games, messenger applications, email, online stores, and more. In simpler terms, everything that you encounter in a web browser and all background processes have been created by a web developer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on whether or not the content you create is visible or “invisible”, you will be classified as a front-end or back-end developer.</span></p>
<p>If your job requires you to know both front-end and back-end development at the same time, you are considered a full-stack developer.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s take a look at the difference between these two fields. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_8760" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8760" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-8760" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/home-office-5000280_1920-1024x683.jpg" alt="Comfortable and lovely working environment of a programmer" width="1024" height="683" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/home-office-5000280_1920-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/home-office-5000280_1920-300x200.jpg 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/home-office-5000280_1920-768x512.jpg 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/home-office-5000280_1920-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/home-office-5000280_1920-1080x720.jpg 1080w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/home-office-5000280_1920.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-8760" class="wp-caption-text">Comfortable and lovely working environment of a programmer</p></div></p>
<h2><strong>Front-End Development</strong></h2>
<p>Front-end development involves all of the things the user sees on the page when they interact with your site or web application.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A front-end developer takes images, text, design, animations, and colors chosen by the web designer and implements them into the website. They ensure that everything is in place and that data coming from the back-end is being displayed correctly on the user’s web browser. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also determine if all client-side logic is working properly. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their primary tools include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each of these languages controls one of the three vital elements of a web page: content, design, and functionality. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many more languages to learn, but these are the three core tools that a front-end developer must absolutely know. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These days, front-end developers are also expected to know a few frameworks, such as Angular.js, React, Vue.js, and Bootstrap.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A site builder, on the other hand, is an entry-level position within front-end development that involves taking a design and turning it into reality with the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Site builders don’t deal with any of the back-end or server-side languages but focus more on converting artistic vision into computer code. Starting as a site builder requires minimal coding knowledge (compared to other positions) and is a great way to begin your career in web development.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Back-End Development </strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A web developer may also deal with servers, databases, and other things that are “behind the scenes”, so to speak. This particular kind of web development is called, “back-end” development. </span></p>
<p>While a front-end developer will work with everything that the user sees, a back-end developer deals with the unseen processes that create, store, and transfer information from the server to your browser.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While you’ll use some of the knowledge you learned in front-end development, you will need to learn an entirely different toolset to become a back-end developer. This means that you’ll have to learn new programming languages. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some examples of popular back-end languages include Java, Ruby, Python, and PHP. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With experience as a back-end developer, you’ll also be able to take your skills to other IT jobs that involve managing databases and systems. Even though these jobs don’t involve programming, they do require knowledge of server-side processes. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12028 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h2><strong>Database Management</strong></h2>
<p>A database manager is the one who is in charge of taking care of the servers and making sure they run properly.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also spend much of their time to keep data organized and updating the system so that the website runs smoothly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The quality of your database management can affect loading times, your user’s experience on your site, and even your website’s position on the search results page of Google. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good database management can also prevent your site from crashing or returning errors to your users. All of these factors are extremely important and can make or break any website or online business.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process of managing databases also requires one to learn a new set of programming languages. Some of the most widely used tools for database management include Oracle, SQL, and Apache. </span></p>
<h2><strong>System Administration</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to a database manager, system administrators focus on keeping software and hardware running properly and up to date. A system administrator’s job generally consists of installing, upgrading, and monitoring the performance of a system—typically in a corporate setting.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost every large company in the world needs a system admin to maintain the security of their IT structure and to troubleshoot problems as they arise. Company email, business applications, and internal communications are all handled by the system administrator. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without these vital methods of productivity, a business would likely fail in today’s market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A system administrator’s work could be considered boring or mundane, but the tasks that they perform are extremely important and can make or break your IT structure. </span></p>
<h2><strong>What’s the Difference Between a Web Developer and Web Designer?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may have heard the terms Web Developer and <a href="https://webdesigntips.blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Web Designer</a> used interchangeably. However, that doesn’t mean that they are the same thing. </span></p>
<p>A web developer focuses its efforts on programming and dealing with code, while a web designer uses graphic design tools like Photoshop, Illustrator, Sketch, and InDesign to create branding and graphics for the website.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The web developer takes the web designer’s concept and turns it into reality with the use of code. To use a real-life example, a web designer is like an architect who draws the blueprints for a building and creates mock-ups of how the building will look. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like a construction worker, the web developer then takes those plans and starts to construct the building, brick by brick. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although web developers and web designers are two distinct positions, they can often overlap. If you’re a web developer who also likes to play with design, you might use graphics editing software such as PhotoShop to create images, logos, and layouts for your website.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><strong>What Is Web Development Like?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web Development is a fun and rewarding career that gives you a lot of room for creativity and artistic expression. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like any other form of programming, a job in web development may require you to work on an odd schedule and stay available around the clock to fix bugs and problems as they arise. However, many web development jobs will require you to work on a typical 9-to-5 schedule.</span></p>
<p>One of the main advantages of web development is that there are many opportunities to work remotely. This provides you with the freedom and flexibility that you won’t likely find in other careers.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A typical day in the life of a web developer mostly consists of spending time sitting down in front of a computer. Throughout the day, you’ll likely have short meetings with your peers and clients, discuss what to work on, and then begin coding away. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you encounter new problems and challenges, you’ll spend time searching for answers on sites like Stackoverflow.com and online forums for programmers.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll also have multiple tabs open at once, as you juggle your projects, communication, and research. While you work, you’ll spend most of your time writing code in a text editor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These programs make writing code easier and come with a variety of tools that help you stay organized. Coders also use terminals to speak directly to servers and other software for managing databases, handing versions, and much more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the greatest benefits of web development is instant feedback. Since the code is rendered in a web browser, you will be able to see the results of your work on almost any device. You’ll also be able to test your code and fix problems quicker than in other forms of programming. </span></p>
<h2><strong>How Do I Learn Web Development?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chances are, you’re eager to start learning the<a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/a-brief-introduction-to-programming/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external"> basics of web development right now</a>,  and so you’ll want to know exactly where to find the best resources.</span></p>
<p>One of the greatest advantages of learning web development is the ability to learn completely online. Since web developers spend most of their time in front of a computer, tutorials, documentation, and classes are all available on the internet.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you prefer a more formal style of education, you may want to check out courses at your local university or enrol in accelerated classes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re a fast-paced learner, you might also want to enrol in a coding bootcamp, which is a short and condensed learning program that operates as a military bootcamp.

<h2><strong>How Long Does it Take to Learn Web Development?</strong></h2>
<p>Web development, like any other skill,<a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/how-long-it-takes-to-learn-to-code/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external"> takes time and practice to learn.</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to learn to play the guitar or the piano, you have to set specific hours to practice per day and really invest in levelling up your abilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, the time it takes to learn web development is best measured in hours. The total length of time it takes to learn web development will then be limited by the number of hours per day that you dedicate to learning it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s say that it takes 200 hours to learn the necessary skills to become a front-end developer. You could spend 1 hour per day and take 200 weeks, or spend 5 hours per day and complete it in 40 weeks. It all depends on your learning pace. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your brain is also limited and can’t possibly learn for 24 hours per day. For most students, the suggested limit for studying is about 6-8 hours per day, but that’s not the case with everyone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your real goal should be to get quality study time and to retain the majority of what you learned. If you’re studying web programming for 12 hours a day and you feel like you can’t remember anything the next day, you should probably reduce that amount. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, if it takes a fixed amount of hours to learn something, we should probably be asking a better question, “How long does it take to complete your education?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, that will depend on the path you take. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking the traditional route and getting your Computer Science degree at a university will take you at least 4 years. However, even after you have gotten your degree you will have to spend your free time learning various programming languages and doing internships to learn the skills you need. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Computer Science programs also tend to teach you overarching concepts in computing, such as mathematics, electronics, telecommunications, and more.  </span></p>
<p>The good news is that most web developer jobs don’t require a Computer Science degree. <span style="font-weight: 400;">This brings us to our next two options: coding bootcamps and online courses.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A coding bootcamp is an accelerated program that generally takes an average of 14 weeks, or 3.5 months, to complete. Just like attending a university for a semester, you’ll have to live near the location of the bootcamp to participate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you happen to live far away, you’ll have to move and find temporary housing for the duration of the bootcamp. </span></p>
<p>Online courses combine the flexibility and condensed nature of a bootcamp while providing you with the ability to work at your own pace and learn from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to incredible convenience, online courses provide you with the same high-quality education while saving you a lot of time and money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of renting temporary housing, commuting to the university, and buying expensive materials, online classes only require that you have a computer and a stable internet connection. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s a total no-brainer. </span></p>

<h2><strong>Is Web Development Right for Me?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you read our previous articles on programming, you already know the qualities that a web developer needs to have. </span></p>
<p>These qualities include high attention to detail, problem-solving skills, patience, the desire to learn, and a love for technology.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if you find it hard to sit down for hours at a time, have trouble concentrating, and don’t like computers, you might want to reconsider. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Difficulty typing and a low GWAM (General Words A Minute) may also prevent you from truly enjoying programming and completing tasks on time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you meet all of the requirements above and have a passion for the field, you have what it takes to pursue a career in web development. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your next step is to determine what languages are right for you and where to start. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">See you in the next article, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“<a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/beginners-guide-to-java-programming-language/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Beginner’s Guide to Java Programming Languag</a>e”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<h3><b>What Is Java? </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Java (not to be confused with JavaScript) is a <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/g/generalp.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">general-purpose programming language</a> that was designed to run on a wide variety of devices, ranging from smartphones and PCs to smart TVs. According to the </span><a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stack Overflow Developer Survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Java is the 5th most popular programming language, right below SQL.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12017 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although created back in 1995 by Sun Microsystems, the Java programming language is still popular today. Java is like a simpler version of C++ that takes many design cues from its predecessor, Oak. Java’s slogan, <a href="https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/write-once-run-anywhere-WORA" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">“WORA,”</a> is an acronym that stands for “Write Once, Run Anywhere.” After the code is written in Java, it can run on any compatible device with Java installed without the need for recompilation.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_8777" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8777" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-8777" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/concept-2791440_1920-1024x540.jpg" alt="With a good idea and some Java knowledge you can create amazing things in short time" width="1024" height="540" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/concept-2791440_1920-1024x540.jpg 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/concept-2791440_1920-300x158.jpg 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/concept-2791440_1920-768x405.jpg 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/concept-2791440_1920-1536x810.jpg 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/concept-2791440_1920-1080x570.jpg 1080w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/concept-2791440_1920.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-8777" class="wp-caption-text">With a good idea and some Java knowledge you can create amazing things in a short time</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h3><b>To show you what Java programming looks like, we’ll use the classic “Hello World” example:</b></h3>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code class="language-java" lang="java">class HelloWorldApp {

    public static void main(String[ ] args) {

        System.out.printIn(“Hello World!”); // Displays the text on the screen. 

    }

}</code></pre>
<h3><strong>What Is Programming in Java Like? </strong></h3>
<p>Java programming is capable of <a class="rank-math-link" href="https://searchapparchitecture.techtarget.com/definition/object-oriented-programming-OOP" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">object-oriented programming,</a> meaning that it allows you to organize attributes together into objects and classes. Once defined in your program, you can reference them at a later time to save you from writing it all out again. A procedural language, on the other hand, requires you to write out huge lines of code that are dependent on each other. Without the convenience of objects, you always have to restate everything. </p>
<h3><strong>Uses for Java</strong></h3>
<p>The great thing about Java programming is that it is extremely versatile and can be found in just about any industry. In fact, once you’ve learned Java, you will never run out of uses and applications for it. The most common uses for Java include web, mobile, and desktop applications. </p>
<h4><em>Mobile</em></h4>
<p>Android applications can be created entirely in Java, meaning that you can become an Android developer with a good knowledge of Java. </p>

<h4><em>Web</em></h4>
<p>Although websites are made up of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, web applications are made up of various different components that can be written in multiple programming languages. Many web applications rely on server code written in Java. Java also supports the creation of Applets, which are small programs, like games, that can be run directly in the browser.</p>
<h4><em>Desktop</em></h4>
<p>In line with its “Write Once, Run Anywhere” philosophy, Java programming can be used to power desktop applications on multiple operating systems, such as Windows, MacOS, and Linux. While Java is not truly native to any platform, there are plenty of tools that allow you to run Java on any operating system. <a class="rank-math-link" href="https://www.oracle.com/java/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Oracle</a>, the company that bought out Sun Microsystems (the creator of Java) offers developer tools for writing Java programs on various platforms.</p>
<h4><em>Enterprise</em></h4>
<p>Not only is Java a programming language, but it’s also a platform. <a class="rank-math-link" href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-ee-glance.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Java EE, or Java Enterprise Edition,</a> is a special version of the Java platform designed for business applications. Java EE is often used for large-scale networks and comes with a higher level of security for corporations. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><em>Servers</em></h4>
<p>Last, but not least, we have Java for servers. In addition to Java EE, Oracle offers Server JRE, which is a Java platform designed specifically for servers. JRE stands for <a class="rank-math-link" href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5442/java-runtime-environment-jre" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">“Java Runtime Environment”</a>. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Java_Developer/Salary" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Payscale</a>, Java programmers based in the U.S. make an average of $72,611.

<p>Even though you may make substantially less in your own country, you’ll still gain incredible earning potential by learning to code in Java—no matter where you live in the world. Java programmers in places like Malaysia, for example, can make up to 1,200% more than the average national salary in their country). Not bad. (See the data here: <a href="https://jobbatical.com/blog/java-developer-salary-by-countries-2017-infographic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Java Developer Salary: Local &amp; Worldwide Comparison Infographic</a>).</p>
<h3><strong>How Do I Learn Java?</strong></h3>
<p>Due to its huge popularity and high demand, there are plenty of online and offline java tutorials available to help you start learning. To find out more, check out our article, “<a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/how-to-learn-to-code/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">How to Learn to Code</a>”.</p>
<h3><strong>How Long Does it Take to Learn Java? </strong></h3>
<p>The amount of time <a class="rank-math-link" href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/how-long-it-takes-to-learn-to-code/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">it takes to learn a programming language</a> depends on the methods you use, your learning retention, and how many hours you invest per week. You can’t expect to know everything about Java programming after taking a semester-long course at your local university or a 14-week program at a coding bootcamp. However, depending on your dedication, the basics you need to develop a good foundation can be learned rather quickly.</p>

<h3><strong>Is Java Right for Me?</strong></h3>
<p>One of the best things about software development is that there is a wide variety of languages out there. If you simply despise programming in Java, for example, there are plenty of alternatives to choose from. Education never really stops. </p>
<p>For most, the basics of Java programming is a good place to start, because it allows you to program for a wide variety of devices and applications with just one single language. </p>
<p>However, if you’re just getting started in programming and are unsure if Java programming is right for you, please check out our article, “<a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/which-programming-language-is-right-for-you/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Which Programming Language Is Right for Me</a>”.</p>

<h3><b>Uses for C++</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With C++, you can create all kinds of cool things, such as <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/659948/what-are-aaa-triple-a-video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">AAA video games</a>, powerful desktop applications, and mobile apps. As a low-level language, C++ is harder to understand but gives you more control over the hardware. Some even say that C++ programming helps you “get closer to the metal”. This is what makes it the perfect choice for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBRXOZSUw54" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">developing video games</a> for consoles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also use C++ in systems programming, embedded systems, and back-end web development. C++ programming is great for creating or tweaking operating systems and device drivers. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12017 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3><b>What Is C++?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C++ is a general-purpose programming language that builds upon the basics of C, one of the most widely used programming languages of all time. Over the years, C has been gradually replaced by modern improvements upon the language, such as C++ and C#. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C++ was first invented in 1985 by Bjarne Stroustrup, who wanted a faster, more powerful version of the C programming language (created in 1972). Although it contains much of C’s syntax, C++ added new features, such as classes, which makes it capable of object-oriented programming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the C programming language, “++” increases the value of a numeric variable (i.e. 1 would become 2). Bjarne added this to the name of C++ to communicate that this new language was a more advanced, evolved version of C.    </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, C++ holds the place of its predecessor as one of the most popular programming languages today. </span></p>
<h3><b>What Is Programming in C++ Like?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s what the<a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"> basics of C++ programming</a> look like using the “Hello World” example:</span></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code class="language-cpp" lang="cpp">#include &lt;iostream&gt;
int main()
{
  std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, world!\n";
}</code></pre>
<h3><strong>How Much Do C++ Programmers Make?</strong></h3>
<p>According to data from<a class="rank-math-link" href="https://www.indeed.com/career/c%2B%2B-developer/salaries?from=top_sb" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"> indeed.com</a>, C++ developers in the United States, who have worked in their positions for 1-3 years, make an average of $116,115 per year, which is $9676.25 per month before taxes. This, of course, includes many salaries from expensive areas such as San Francisco and New York where salaries are inflated for the cost of living.</p>

<h3><strong>How Do I Learn C++?</strong></h3>
<p>C++ programming is known as a rather complex and difficult-to-learn language. For this reason, many programmers choose to start by learning HTML, CSS, and a programming language like JavaScript. That way, they can start their coding career in Web Development and learn C++ along the way while they’re already making money and gaining programming experience. </p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1357" class="wp-image-8697" src="https://i2.wp.com/codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/robot-507811_1920-1.jpg?fit=1024%2C724&amp;ssl=1" alt="C++ programming helps you “get closer to the metal”

<h3><strong>If you’d like to take the challenge to learn C++, there are a few steps you’ll want to take:</strong></h3>
<p>The first step is to enrol in a Computer Science program at your local university. As a low-level programming language, you’ll want to know most of the underlying concepts of computer programming before starting C++. </p>
<p>However, you’ll also have to spend plenty of time outside the classroom, since a Computer Science program is more often focused on teaching you concepts rather than skills. </p>
<p>Therefore, the second step to learning C++ programming is finding good print and <a class="rank-math-link" href="https://www.learncpp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">digital resources</a> you can study in your free time. There are plenty of books and manuals available out there that can teach you <a class="rank-math-link" href="http://cplusplus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">how to program in C++</a>, as well as online classes and tutorials. Because C++ has been around for such a long time, you might even find some good books on programming C++ at your local library.</p>
<p>The third step is to seek out online communities, forums, and message boards where you can get help from more experienced C++ programmers. Continue to practice and ask the community whenever you get stuck and can’t figure out a solution yourself. Websites like Cplusplus.com have forums where users actively discuss related topics and answer questions.</p>
<h3><strong>How Long Does it Take to Learn C++ programming?</strong></h3>
<p>The amount of time it takes to learn a programming language depends on the methods you use, your learning retention, and how many hours you invest per week. You can’t expect to know everything about C++ programming after taking a semester-long course at your local university or a 14-week program at a coding bootcamp. </p>
<p>If you already have a background in C programming, you can probably expect to spend about 3 or 4 months learning the additional features of C++. However, if you’re starting from scratch with this language, you will probably spend over 6 months to learn it at the most basic level. </p>
<p>To learn C++ at a high enough level to get a C++ programming job would most likely take you 3-4 years. Unfortunately, even C++ programmers with decades of experience still regard it as one of the most difficult languages to write. </p>

<h3><strong>Is C++ Right for Me?</strong></h3>
<p>To determine if a programming language is right for you, you first need to figure out how it lines up with your long-term goals. </p>
<p>Learning C++ programming isn’t for the faint of heart. It will undoubtedly take you years of study and practice. So, you should definitely be sure of your decision before embarking upon this long journey. </p>
<p>Since you probably won’t be able to learn C++ without any previous background in programming, we recommend beginners start with more basic languages like HTML, CSS, and, JavaScript.</p>
<p>To learn if C++ programming is a good fit for you, please check out our article, “<a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/which-programming-language-is-right-for-you/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Which Programming Language is Right for Me?</a>”.

<h3><b>Uses for C# programming language</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C# is an object-oriented programming language that is primarily used for developing desktop, mobile, and web-based applications for Windows and other Microsoft products. By using the .NET framework, you can develop nearly anything for Microsoft with C#. Although the .NET framework supports a wide variety of programming languages, such as VB.NET, C++, and F#, C# is the most popular of the bunch. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12017 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>What Exactly Is .NET?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To better understand C# programming, we’ll first need to address .NET, the framework that goes hand in hand with this programming language. Developed by Microsoft, the .NET framework contains a huge number of class libraries (pre-written code) to help developers create applications faster and more efficiently. Because both C# and .NET are products of Microsoft, it’s not very common to see one mentioned without the other. There are, however, a few other frameworks that are used with C#, such as Unity.</span></p>
<h3><b>Game Development in Unity</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://unity.com/learn/get-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Unity</a> is a framework for C# that is specifically designed for creating video games. Today, Unity is the most widely-used game engine, with over a third of top-selling games having been built with it. Unity is also currently used for the development of most VR games. Approximately 90% of all Samsung Gear and 53% of all Oculus Rift games have been developed with Unity. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_8741" style="width: 333px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8741" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-8741" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Unity-LEGO.jpg" alt="This is how game developing looks like with Unity" width="323" height="500" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Unity-LEGO.jpg 323w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Unity-LEGO-194x300.jpg 194w" sizes="(max-width: 323px) 100vw, 323px" /><p id="caption-attachment-8741" class="wp-caption-text">This is how game developing looks like with Unity</p></div></p>
<h3><b>Web Development</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the main benefits of choosing C# as your go-to programming language is being able to use Microsoft’s huge library of tools for web development. Through ASP.NET (a part of the .NET framework), one can develop websites, web pages, and other web applications with C#.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_8742" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8742" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-8742" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/configure-web-app-project-framework-1024x711.png" alt="With ASP.NET you can develop C#-based websites" width="1024" height="711" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/configure-web-app-project-framework-1024x711.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/configure-web-app-project-framework-300x208.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/configure-web-app-project-framework-768x533.png 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/configure-web-app-project-framework.png 1026w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-8742" class="wp-caption-text">With ASP.NET you can develop C#-based websites</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although C# and .NET tend to go hand in hand, it’s not necessary to use the framework to program with C#. They simply work well together, due to being developed by Microsoft. </span></p>
<h3><b>Mobile Development </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to the .NET framework, you can develop mobile applications for Windows, iOS, and Android with C#. While previously limited to just Windows phone development, Microsoft recently opened up the .NET framework to cross-platform development, due to the commercial failure of the Windows phone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than stay dedicated to Windows phone and see their mobile development tools fail along with it, Microsoft decided it would be better to allow iOS and Android developers to use Visual Studio. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_8743" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8743" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-8743" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Codelane2x-600x450-1.png" alt="That’s how developing looks like in VisualStudio" width="600" height="450" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Codelane2x-600x450-1.png 600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Codelane2x-600x450-1-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-8743" class="wp-caption-text">That’s how developing looks like in VisualStudio</p></div></p>
<h3><b>Cross-Platform Development</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although they are unaffiliated with Microsoft, third-party IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) like <a href="https://www.monodevelop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">MonoDevelop</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/get-started/installation/windows" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Xamarin Studios</a> allow you to use C# and the .NET framework to develop for Mac OS and Linux. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of this added capability, C# programming can now be used to develop just about anything on any platform, from Xbox and Android to Mac OS and Web. </span></p>
<h3><b>What Is C#?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the year 2000, Anders Hejlsberg at Microsoft developed C# to compete with Java, which was created by Sun Microsystems. Despite having much in common with Java, Hejlsberg stated that C# had much more in common with C++. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pronounced as “C-Sharp,” the name “C#” comes from the musical notation that indicates making a note one semitone higher in pitch. C# also resembles C++++ with the plus symbols being arranged in a 2&#215;2 grid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following in the footsteps of other modern programming languages like Java and C++, C# is a general-purpose, object-oriented language that aims to deliver both simplicity and performance. </span></p>
<h3><b>What Is Programming in C# Like?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s what C# code looks like using the “Hello World” example:</span></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code class="language-csharp" lang="csharp">using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!");
    }
}</code></pre>
<h3><strong>How Much Do C# Programmers Make?</strong></h3>
<p>Because the .NET framework allows you to create a wide variety of programs, the salary of a C# developer can vary depending on their area of expertise. For example, a C# developer who creates websites and web apps may make much less than a software engineer or senior .NET developer, although they both use C#. </p>
<p>According to data from <a class="rank-math-link" href="https://www.indeed.com/career/.net-developer/salaries" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">indeed.com,</a> C# developers in the United States make an average of $67,970 per year, which is $5664.17 per month before taxes and have worked in their current position for 1-4 years. This, of course, includes many salaries from expensive areas such as San Francisco and New York where salaries are inflated for cost of living.</p>
<h3><strong>How Do I Learn C#?</strong></h3>
<p>There are a variety of paths you can take towards learning C#, such as online courses, university programs, and coding bootcamps.</p>
<h4><em>Online Courses</em></h4>
<p>One of the best (and cheapest) ways to learn C# is directly from Microsoft themselves. Through<a class="rank-math-link" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/virtual-academy/9wzdncrdk13l" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"> Microsoft’s Virtual Academy</a>, you can learn how to program in C# and use the .NET framework for free with their series of tutorial videos and resources. </p>
<p>Just visit Microsoft’s page to start watching the tutorials and follow along. You can even get certification from Microsoft Virtual Academy that you can place on your resume. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><em>University</em></h4>
<p>As we often tell our students, a university education will always give you a broader picture and teach you the underlying concepts of programming. However, studying Computer Science doesn’t guarantee that you’ll know how to code upon graduation. </p>
<p>During your 4 years in university, you’ll spend the majority of your time learning about mathematics, electronics, and the fundamentals of how computer languages work. If you want to learn a specific language, such as C#, you’ll still have to invest your own personal time into studying it.  </p>
<h4><em>Coding Bootcamps</em></h4>
<p>For those of you who are interested in skipping a formal education and pursuing a career right away, online courses and bootcamps provide a much more accelerated learning path. They also focus on teaching you the skills you need to perform your job, rather than fully understanding every line of code.   </p>
<h3><strong>How Long Does it Take to Learn C# programming for beginners?</strong></h3>
<p>Just like any skill, the time it takes to learn a certain programming language can vary greatly from person to person. If you already have a background in coding, you can expect to take anywhere from 2 to 3 months to learn the very basic of C# programming. </p>
<p>Building the skills and knowledge you need to get a job as a developer, on the other hand, will take you around 1 to 2 years of practice. </p>
<p>Unlike web development languages, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it’s difficult to absorb all of the content needed to get a job as a C# developer in one concentrated, 14-week course. For this reason, it’s much less common to find coding bootcamps that teach C#. </p>
<p>And while a coding bootcamp will definitely teach you a lot about C#, it’s recommended that you take additional time to study and practice before launching yourself into a career as a C# or .NET developer.  </p>

<h3><strong>Is C# Right for Me?</strong></h3>
<p>Before deciding whether or not to learn a programming language, it’s always best to first figure out how it lines up with your long-term goals. </p>
<p>C# is considered by many programmers as a rather difficult language to learn, making it a less-than-optimal choice for first-time coders. This isn’t to say that it’s impossible to learn from scratch, but it does carry a rather steep learning curve. </p>
<p>Because you’ll want to have previous experience with programming before learning C#, we would recommend that beginners start with more basic languages, like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. </p>
<p>To learn if C# is a good fit for you, please check out our article, “<a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/which-programming-language-is-right-for-you/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Which Programming Language is Right for Me?</a>”.
