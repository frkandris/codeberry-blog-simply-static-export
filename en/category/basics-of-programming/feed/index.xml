										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you decide to become a backend developer, you will have to work on multiple use cases and codebases of different programming languages and frameworks. There will always be scope for learning something new with each task. And the best part about being a backend engineer is that you have a wide choice of technologies to choose from. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you consider which programming languages and frameworks to learn and which are the most used among backend engineers? Read on and find out the most popular backend technologies</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and the required knowledge and skills corresponding to each of them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12017 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png" alt="Best backend technologies in 2021" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Leading Backend Technologies</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you pick a technology to gain proficiency in, you should consider a few points that can help you choose the best option for you:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we are going to go through some points that might come up when you are taking your first steps in getting to know the basics of programming. We will do a short introduction of the most popular programming areas and languages, talk about the issues around making some big decisions (about what technology and learning format to choose) and say a few words about the personal and technical background necessary for this venture. We will also make some book and video tutorial recommendations in the hope of motivating you to start studying.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12017 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h2>Programming as an umbrella term – and its many meanings</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we hear that someone is a programmer, we can already assume that he is doing some complex and interesting work that requires a lot of careful attention. But that is not really enough information for us to tell what he actually does, what an average day of his is like, and what kind of tasks he has to deal with. Coding is such a diverse field that it can be considered only a very generic term in this form, spreading over countless areas as a giant umbrella. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, there is one thing that all these areas have in common: they all involve communication with computers. And the way to do that is writing program codes, which is done by programmers. (Who also do testing, debugging, and documenting; they communicate with clients, learn and teach, do teamwork or work individually on a personal project.) If you would like to learn more about the above-mentioned communication through descriptive examples, check out our article titled </span><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/a-brief-introduction-to-programming/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Brief Introduction to Programming</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what do we mean when we say that programming is present in countless areas? Think about all the various devices, applications, platforms you use daily. Software for web pages, mobile apps, games, desktop applications, embedded devices (for example, smart household appliances), and so on—the list is infinite. Creating and operating each of these involves different programming areas and technologies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Different criteria are applied and different technologies are needed for designing and creating the things that you see as a user, and those running on the server-side. Various technologies call for various programming languages.</span></p>
<h2>The most popular programming languages</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several surveys looking at the most popular programming languages. But what exactly do we mean by popular? Surveys conducted in this subject are not looking for the best programming language, as there is no “best programming language”—only adequate and less adequate ones for a given task, need, or purpose, and ones that can or cannot be used in a given situation or for a given platform. The </span><a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">source</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we used when writing this article shows the languages in which the biggest number of lines were written in a particular month, so technically, it measures which languages are used the most. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to this, most of the code written was created in Java, C, Python, C++, and C</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">♯</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Visual Basic, JavaScript, SQL, PHP, and R are also quite high up in the rankings. The diagram clearly shows how the popularity of languages has changed over time. There are several things to consider when you decide to learn one or the other programming language, the most important of which is the purpose you need it for, your goals relevant to programming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can read some hints and tips on finding the right programming language for you in our article titled </span><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/which-programming-language-is-right-for-you/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which Programming Language is Right for You?</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2>The many ways of gaining new skills – Learning the basics of programming</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many ways to get started when you want to learn something new, and programming is no exception either. But whatever learning method you choose, you will need patience, perseverance, and diligence if you want to learn to code.</span></p>
<h3>Individual learning</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Individual learning can be an attractive option for several reasons. One of its biggest advantages is that you can set your own schedule, spend as much time on studying as you want, and study whenever it is most convenient for you. You can fit the pace and the frequency of reviewing and practicing to your personal needs; you can go back and forth in the material as needed; you don’t have to adjust to others. For the individual study, it is best to use multiple resources, check out online learning materials, tutorials, books, and find the format that suits you best. You don’t have to stick to one particular method, various methods could complement each other perfectly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, learning by yourself also has a flip side: apart from forums, you don’t have many channels where you can ask for help if you get stuck. The external motivation that your peers and mentors would bring can make a real difference in your growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are hybrid solutions too, combining the benefit of studying at your own pace and the support of a student community and mentors. That is also how it is done at CodeBerry, where you can join a virtual community and receive online mentoring. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12028 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3>Courses and higher education programs</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also choose from a wide range of options if you would like to study in a course, with well-prepared instructors, enthusiastic classmates, and a carefully structured curriculum. When talking about courses, most of us would probably think of “offline”, classroom-based education, which has many excellent opportunities for team building, developing communication skills, and fun lessons spent together. But you can also learn programming in online courses, from anywhere in the world. If there are no coding courses where you live or you don’t want to waste time or money on commuting, then online courses are the right choice for you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also study coding on the university level, which involves acquiring a much larger theoretical knowledge base, but much less practical experience. You will get to understand complex mathematical problems and gain a deep understanding of operations running in the background of programming. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can find more tips on how to learn the basics of programming in our post titled </span><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/how-to-learn-to-code/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Learn to Code</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including a more detailed account of various learning formats and beginner-friendly coding languages. </span></p>
<h2>Technical requirements</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have been interested in programming for some time and you have gathered a lot of information on it already, or you are no stranger to the IT scene (you just haven’t happened to start coding yet), then you will be familiar with the expressions used in this section. If you are coming from a different background and haven’t had anything to do with coding yet, then maybe you’ll be wondering about similar questions as the ones below. </span></p>
<h3>Computer and operating system</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What kind of computer and operating system is needed for programming; what do these need to be capable of? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can write code on a simple laptop or desktop computer; you don’t need to get a supercomputer developed by NASA. The most common commercial operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS) will be perfectly enough. </span></p>
<h3>Development environment</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where do I write the code? What environment should I use? You can write programs in text editors, integrated development environments, or online editing platforms. They all have their advantages, and everyone can choose the option that suits their work, needs, and wallet the best.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to work in a text editor, you can use the Atom, Notepad++, Sublime Text, etc. platforms. These allow you to write and edit your code comfortably, they ensure a clear presentation and have a number of extra features such as syntax highlighting and a help menu. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Integrated development environments (or IDEs) are applications that recognize the syntax of the given language, help prevent bugs, and create nested code. They also have templates, and they can be customized through additional plug-ins and preferences. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eclipse, Visual Studio Code, Webstorm</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, etc. are all examples for IDEs. Companies often require their developers to work in a certain IDE, and buy them access to a professional development environment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, as a beginner (and in many coding areas later on as well), simple online editing platforms, such as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">codepan.io</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">repl.it</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, will serve you just fine</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At CodeBerry, one of the first things you will learn is to create a development environment for yourself and get to know GitHub, a free online platform where you can store and share your code. Of course, there are other version control applications available beside </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">GitHub</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> too: for example, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitbucket</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">GitLab</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2>What skills are needed for programming?</h2>
<h3>Analytical thinking</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are thinking about enrolling in a university-level programming course, you should know that you will need very strong skills and knowledge of mathematics to start with, and you won’t be able to go around that. Contrary to this, other courses, practice-oriented training, and individual learning can be successful even when requiring much less or not as deep theoretical knowledge as university programs do, so you usually don’t need such high-level math for them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What you will definitely need though is logical, analytical thinking. In order to understand and learn algorithms, you will need a deep, analytical, rational thinking, if not traditional mathematical capabilities. You will also have to know certain basic concepts and understand basic programming operations. It is best to practice these a lot, and to go back to them from time to time, so you can use them with absolute confidence. </span></p>
<h3>Coding courses in your native language and the role of English in programming</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The role of the English language in programming is an important question. Many people could feel discouraged by not having solid English skills, while the world of IT seems to be working mostly in English. So how can you enter it if you happen to have some shortcomings in this regard? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CodeBerry offers a solution to this problem by providing an opportunity to learn coding in your native language, and there are more and more resources (books, podcasts, videos, courses) available in Hungarian. You can find some recommendations in this article. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So you don’t necessarily need strong English skills to start learning and to improve your programming skills successfully. Still, it is well worth it to work on your English skills: the ability to read international forums, articles, novelties and descriptions, the labor market advantages that come with it and the access to the global IT scene are just some of the reasons for which you should get better acquainted with the language of international communication.</span></p>
<h3>Personal skills</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an article on the basics of programming, we can’t skip mentioning what every enthusiastic beginner should be aware of: the persistence and deep focus needed for learning to code and to work as a programmer. Whatever format you are learning in, you won’t be successful without diligence and disciplined practice. But if you have these, you can immerse yourself in rewarding creative work, exciting and challenging problem-solving processes, and you will gain a substantial advantage on the job market. </span></p>

<h3>Teamwork skills</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you think of coding as more than a hobby, and you can see yourself working as a professional programmer, chances are that you will have to work in a team or cooperate with clients, which requires good communication and cooperative skills. It is also important that you can present what you are working on, the relevant issues, and your findings in a clear, concise, and efficient manner. These are all skills that can be improved, and which are essential for efficient programming teamwork.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is impossible to include every aspect of the basics of programming in a single article, but we hope that you could find some useful insights in this post. If you are reading this to research the topic before starting to learn to code, have a look at </span><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/things-i-wish-someone-had-told-me-when-i-was-learning-how-to-code/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this personal account of the beginnings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the challenges, and the beauty of learning to code.</span></p>

<li><strong>How to find the right beginner programming course for you?</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>Before you begin—Step 0</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve been considering getting to know the world of coding, you may want to get an idea of the available options for learning the basics first. To be able to choose from the various courses in the market, you have to know what you can expect from different introductory, junior programmer, and developer courses. That is what we were trying to help you with by compiling this summary.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12017 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h2>Changing career, returning to the labor market with kids, or finding programming courses for kids?</h2>
<h3>There is a course for you, whatever your situation may be</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The structure of the training courses mostly depends on the target group they are designed for. Programs aimed at children, high school students, people wanting to change careers or mothers trying to return to the labor market are paced differently and use different methodologies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Younger students can practice the basics of analytical thinking and programming in a fun way. Mothers can join training programs that accommodate their lifestyle while they have small children: these programs organize child care services next to the classroom and adjust the schedule so that it supports family life, helping them develop a new routine allowing mothers to learn a new profession.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those wanting to study while also working or in university can choose from part-time courses. Others might want to get the skills necessary to start building their career in IT sooner, in a matter of months or even weeks. For them, bootcamps will be the perfect option: although these require 8–10 hours spent on studying daily, which is the equivalent of a full-time job, they offer a super fast-paced learning experience.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the structure of a course does not necessarily depend on the target audience entirely. Some technologies simply cannot be learned with a few months’ intensive training. The next part of the article will talk about technologies and some other factors affecting the available selection of courses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the courses available for various target groups</span></p>

</ul>
<h2>What would you like to do in the future; what job can you see yourself doing?</h2>
<h3>Your choice of technology should depend on this</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Various fields and positions in IT require knowledge of different technologies. In order to choose the right programming language to learn, you should figure out what you want to do exactly in the early stages of planning your new career. Full-stack web developers need an entirely different set of skills than what is required for developing games or working with artificial intelligence. Different career paths come with different working conditions and different salary ranges, and the programming languages you need to learn will always depend on which direction you want to take. As a programmer, you can be a freelancer, launch your own project, or work as an employee of a small start-up or a multinational company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’d like to work at a big company with a secure background, you might need more complex programming knowledge. Completing a Java programming course</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">will give you valuable skills that can be used in countless areas, while learning the highly complex C++ programming language (which is definitely not recommended for beginners) will make you a very valuable employee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are android programming courses especially designed for creating mobile applications, and you can get into various areas of web development through front-end and back-end technologies. A solid grasp and application of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript languages alone can be enough for building sophisticated and substantial web pages, but for delving into data science, you will want to opt for languages such as R or Python. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We could go on, but the point has been made: start in the direction that will take you to your chosen destination. </span></p>
<h2>Course length, schedule, pace and mentoring</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we have mentioned at the beginning of the article, programming schools offer courses of various lengths: a few weeks, months, or even a couple of years. The length of a course depends on the volume of the learning material and the course schedule.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Courses that can be completed within a few weeks mostly function as an introduction to the world of coding; they help you decide whether this path is right for you and which direction to take. Super intensive courses, or bootcamps, usually take up your whole day, and they give you the capabilities necessary for starting a new career, a complex set of web development skills for example, within a few months. Other programming courses take up only a couple of hours of your time every week, but they will last for many months and you will probably have to do homework too.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another significant factor to consider is whether it is an online course, or one held offline, in a real classroom. The benefit of on-campus training is that you can work together with the student community in real time and space, it can give you external motivation and reassurance, and you can use the professional equipment and technology installed there.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12028 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Online courses vary in their schedule, which can be set as remote teaching with a fixed class schedule and group work, or it could let students progress at their own pace entirely. Choosing this option has the benefit of being able to study anywhere, usually with a partially or fully flexible schedule, at your own pace. Having the option to set your own schedule is great, but it needs serious perseverance and some self-discipline to make the most of it. Of course, these are also important if you progress together with a school or community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your progress will be guided by a mentor most often, but various schools have different solutions in this regard. There could be a single mentor for a whole group of students, or mentors could be assigned to each student individually. A rather common approach is to let the students progress on their own, with the option of asking questions and getting answers from a mentor anytime. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If mentoring is not part of the given course, you might still be able to ask questions and support each other in a virtual student community. Of course, there are also curriculums that you will have to learn all by yourself. </span></p>
<h2>The role of practice in the learning process</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like any new skill you learn, programming needs a lot of practice before you can use it confidently. Not every course incorporates the same amount of theory and practical exercises in its curriculum. Some schools focus on creating a project together, where you can learn your new skills by working through each stage of the project. Others let you code on your own to create a website, application, game, etc. There are even courses using agile methods, coaching, and teamwork to simulate a corporate environment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certain programming schools arrange apprenticeships for their graduated students at partner companies, so that they can deepen their knowledge as paid interns.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12019 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h2>Programming schools with job guarantee? Prepaid or postpaid options?</h2>
<h3>A short note on payment structures</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many programming schools now offer to support you in finding a job, and some provide a full job guarantee. That means that if you cannot find a suitable job within a certain time period after completing the course, you get a refund, or in case of postpaid courses, you don’t have to pay the tuition fee. If your job hunt is successful, you can pay the course fees from the salary you earn as a programmer in the postpaid system. There is a wide range of coding courses in terms of fees and payment options, including free programming courses, state-funded education, and various scholarships.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see, there are many options to choose from—you just need to find the one that’s best for you. The multitude of available courses might seem a little overwhelming now, but don’t panic: all you need is a little planning, self-awareness and research to get one step closer to making the right decision about where you should start learning to code. </span></p>

</ul>
<h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, programming skills are in high demand. According to the CNBC article, “<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/22/glassdoor-the-20-best-jobs-in-america-in-2019.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">The 20 Best Jobs in America in 2019</a>”, Software Engineering is the 10th best job with a median base pay of $104,000 per year. In addition, this list includes a number of other jobs in which programming skills would be extremely beneficial, if not a specific requirement. The top job specified is Data Engineer. It’s perfectly reasonable to expect that programming skills would go a long way in helping you land a role in this field. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we’re going to go over some of the many reasons why you should </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">learn programming</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and how it could change your life. This could be through obtaining a new career or simply building some cool stuff to show off to your friends. We’re going to talk about money and the ways in which coding skills can be applied in various different areas. We’re also going to talk about how gaining these competencies can actually help you develop as a person in an increasingly digital world.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12017 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3><b>Money</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s an unavoidable fact: salaries are super important. Most people want to know that any time investment they make into learning new skills will pay off in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned above, some of the most sought-after skills in today’s world are programming related. From simple scripting to building software that will push the boundaries of science as we know it &#8211; see Katie Bouman’s amazing black-hole imaging program &#8211; technology is becoming increasingly intrinsic to the very fabric of society. And code is what drives it all. So, it may not come as a surprise that companies will pay a ton of money to get great developers into their teams.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some stats about software salaries to get you excited about your future prospects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to payscale.com, entry-level software engineers get paid these salaries in the following US cities:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York, New York &#8211; $96,200 per year.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco, California &#8211; $112,368 per year.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Austin, Texas &#8211; $79,154 per year.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Remember:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It’s important to do your own research before making any decisions.</span></p>
<h3><b>Control Your Own Destiny</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contrary to popular belief, you don’t need a degree in Computer Science to be a programmer.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> There are very few requirements for getting started; just a computer and an internet connection. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With these two things, you can start learning and taking online courses in no time.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Additionally, there are many free programming resources that come with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">practice problems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This opens up a number of possibilities for the budding programmer. While salaried </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">software development</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> jobs are sometimes better in terms of money, job security and benefits, there are many other avenues available with their own unique appeal. I’ll talk about some of these below.</span></p>
<h4><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freelancing</span></i></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’d like to work for yourself, choose your own clients and even decide when to get out of bed, this might be for you. There are various services on the web which help with this lifestyle, such as Upwork, Codementor, and Freelancer. If you don’t want to use one of these sites, you could court your own clients and build relationships and connections within the industry. A lot of big tech companies started this way &#8211; with just a couple of people working for themselves to build their dream.</span></p>
<h4><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start your own online business</span></i></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have no interest in becoming a software engineer by trade? So what! You can still leverage your programming skills to build your own business, whether that be in e-commerce, private consultancy, construction or… anything really!</span></p>
<h3><b>Develop New Skills</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning to code is more than just </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">learning to code. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s actually learning to think analytically, break down problems, design solutions and loads of other things. For example, if you’re working with others on a project, you’ll learn collaborative skills. If you’re building a complex piece of software or a computer program that you want to ship to others, you’ll learn communication skills, because you need to make sure you document it as well as possible. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12028 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning to code isn’t just about putting words on a screen in a specific order; it’s about transforming the way you think about things. And those kinds of competencies are valuable in any area of modern life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t learn popular programming languages because everyone else is doing it. Choose what you want to learn! </span></p>
<h3><b>Limitless Possibilities</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning to code opens up a world of exciting possibilities, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">whether you decide to learn web development, game development, or Android development</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve learned the basics, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">you can build video games, websites, desktop applications, and mobile apps. You can create scrapers that trawl through web content and gather data. You can build visualization software, which can take large amounts of inaccessible information and present it in a clear manner. Want to build an evil Artificial Intelligence </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">equipped with machine learning</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, enslave humanity and eventually take over the known universe? Why not? You can do that too (maybe).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another fun and creative thing that’s possible with coding skills is generative art. This is the art that is created by drawing pixels onto the screen based on </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">some kind of algorithm.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I came across a website not too long ago that takes three values—day, month &amp; year—and uses them in a mathematical equation to generate an image. You can see an example of this </span><a href="https://www.johndcook.com/expsum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Cool, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also contribute to open-source projects. This is software that’s built under a special license and available for free use in any other software. It’s often a team effort, and a great way to make friends and be a part of something much bigger than just yourself. There are loads of projects out there right now waiting for your input.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are some great examples of things you can do with code, but truthfully, they barely even scratch the surface. The only way you can begin to explore the countless possibilities is to put your hands to the keyboard and get started.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12019 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3><b>Conclusion</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve looked at a few reasons why you should learn programming. We’ve talked about the salary prospects, the ability to control your own destiny, its benefits in helping to develop other skills and all the cool and creative possibilities it brings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, it’s becoming more essential to our very lives each and every day. We live in a digital world, and this is only going to become truer as time progresses. If you start developing these skills now, you can try to ride the wave rather than be helplessly carried along with it. The resources are out there and you can start today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what are you waiting for?</span></p>

<p><a href="https://pixabay.com/photos/laptop-woman-education-study-young-3087585/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7962" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/laptop-3087585_1280.jpg" alt="It’s always exciting to learn how to code" width="1280" height="853" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/laptop-3087585_1280.jpg 1280w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/laptop-3087585_1280-300x200.jpg 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/laptop-3087585_1280-1024x682.jpg 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/laptop-3087585_1280-768x512.jpg 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/laptop-3087585_1280-1080x720.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, let’s start with the most important skills that you’ll need to succeed as a coder: </span></p>
<h3>Good Programming Languages for Beginners</h3>
<h4><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/beginners-guide-to-python-programming-language/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Python</span></em></a></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Python is a powerful, high-level programming language that can be used for a wide variety of purposes such as creating desktop applications, developing web apps, and even solving mathematical equations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you hear the term “high-level programming language,” you might get the idea that it’s more difficult to learn or more complex than others. However, the term “high-level” simply refers to the fact that the language is more developed and that it’s closer to a human language. A high-level language saves you time and frustration by allowing you to write in a more natural manner. Writing in a low-level language may require you to constantly repeat yourself and type out the obvious. Python doesn’t generally do that. Instead, it allows you to create highly readable and maintainable code, which is one of the most important aspects of programming. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting with Python is one of the best ways for beginners to quickly learn the basics of programming and to create a basis for future learning. Thanks to a high number of applications and an easy-to-use syntax, Python is a great language, to begin with as you embark upon your coding journey.</span></p>
<h4><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/beginners-guide-to-javascript/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">JavaScript</span></em></a></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JavaScript is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> programming language that powers the web and makes pages interactive and functional.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re interested in developing websites, JavaScript is an indispensable tool. While it’s true that HTML and CSS handle the organizational and visual aspects of your website, it’s JavaScript that brings everything to life. You’ll be able to create “scripts” that cause the website to react in a certain way when you click on a button, enter information into a form, and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to its popularity, there are plenty of resources available for learning JavaScript online, such as coding bootcamps and university courses. JavaScript is also incredibly versatile, as it can either be used in the front end or in the back end with the use of a run-time environment like Node.js.</span></p>
<h4><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/beginners-guide-to-java-programming-language/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Java</span></em></a></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to being one of the most popular programming languages in the world, Java (not to be confused with JavaScript) is extremely versatile and can be used in a wide variety of applications. And if you decide to learn Java, there’s a good chance of landing a job at a large corporation. Java, along with JavaScript and Python, is used by tech giants like Google, Facebook, and many more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you learn Java, you will open up a whole new world of possibilities in your career as a software engineer. Using Java, you’ll be able to write computer programs for a huge variety of devices, such as smartphones, ATMs, TVs, computers, and more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Java, you can also become a mobile developer for Android. Although iOS development was the trend in recent years (iOS uses Swift), creating apps for Android devices has become more commonplace. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to its popularity, there is an abundance of resources for learning Java, both online and in the real world.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://pixabay.com/hu/photos/otthoni-iroda-munka%C3%A1llom%C3%A1s-iroda-336378/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7964" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/home-office-336378_1280.jpg" alt="Which one is the easiest programming language?" width="1280" height="853" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/home-office-336378_1280.jpg 1280w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/home-office-336378_1280-300x200.jpg 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/home-office-336378_1280-1024x682.jpg 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/home-office-336378_1280-768x512.jpg 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/home-office-336378_1280-1080x720.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></a></p>
<h3>Educational Programs</h3>
<h4><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coding Bootcamps </span></em></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we briefly mentioned in our “<a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/a-brief-introduction-to-programming/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Introduction to Web Development</a>” article, coding bootcamps are short and condensed learning programs that function like military bootcamps. You probably won’t be running through tires and scrubbing the toilet with your toothbrush, but you’ll definitely be pushed to your mental limits with one of these intensive courses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coding bootcamps generally last about 14 weeks (3-4 months) and teach you the fundamental skills that you need to succeed in a specific role, such as full-stack developer or frontend developer. Many employers often search for up-and-coming developers at the end of the program and choose from the best talent among the group. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If one could truly learn everything there is to know about programming in 14 weeks, no one would pursue a degree in Computer Science or spend years developing their skills. Coding bootcamps, however, teach you the skills you need for entry-level programming jobs that don’t necessarily require a CS degree. When you’re just starting out and are looking for your first programming job, a coding bootcamp could be a great fit for you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coding bootcamps are also a great option for those who want a quick overview of coding and need to learn the basics as soon as possible. To continue learning, however, we recommend that you supplement your education with more courses, additional reading materials, and daily practice. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12017 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h4><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">University Courses</span></em></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Undoubtedly the most traditional form of education, a university program will provide you with a great overview of Computer Science and will help you to understand the underlying concepts behind the code. However, don’t expect your professors to hold your hand and teach you how to code in Python, JavaScript, or C++. Universities do offer courses that teach you the basics of each language, but you’ll spend more of your time learning very complex mathematics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For jobs in research, or at high-profile companies like Google, you’ll want to complete a Computer Science degree. However, if your dream job is to work at a medium-sized company or game studio, there’s a good chance that you won’t need to attend a University. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a university course, you’ll learn ideas, concepts, and theories, but very few skills that you can use immediately upon graduation. It’s up to you to learn various programming languages and search out the resources you need to succeed. This may be a disappointing reality for some when they graduate with a degree in Computer Science and leave the university lacking a sense of accomplishment. Regardless, being self-motivated and seeking out new knowledge on your own is a key characteristic of successful coders. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is why we recommend that both graduates and those currently enrolled in a Computer Science program learn to code on their own time. Online courses, coding bootcamps, and supplemental resources will all help you become a programming pro. </span></p>
<h4><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online Courses </span></em></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online courses combine the best of traditional education with the skill-focused philosophy of a coding bootcamp. Not only will you learn the overarching concepts and theories behind programming, but you’ll also learn the skills you need to get a job. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The freedom to study where, when, and how you want provides online learners with the flexibility that isn’t available to traditional students. You won’t need to quit your job, move to a new city, and pay thousands of dollars in tuition to learn valuable skills. Instead, you’ll be able to develop professionally in the comfort of your own home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online courses also come at a fraction of the cost of a university program. An online class generally provides you with the resources you need in a digital format and, unlike a course at your local university, you probably won’t have to spend anything on old, outdated textbooks. Instead, you’ll have access to a specialized curriculum that is written by industry professionals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For English speakers, there are a variety of courses available online, such as Codecademy. Codecademy is a free resource that teaches you the basics of a variety of different programming languages. However, if you want to choose a specific career path, such as web development, data science, or computer science, you’ll have to sign up for the pro (paid) version. The pro version also gives you access to more advanced material. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">CodeBerry</a>, you’ll find in-depth courses that are specialized for specific career paths, such as sitebuilder or front-end developer. In addition to teaching you programming in your own language, CodeBerry also assigns you a coding mentor, pairs you up with a learning buddy, and gives you access to a friendly online community.   </span></p>
<h3>Supplemental Resources:</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although only 20% of the world’s population speaks English, it’s estimated that over 55% of the internet is written in English. This means that the majority of resources you find online won’t be written in your native language. Therefore, the availability of the following resources will vary depending on your native language. </span></p>
<h4><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watch Videos </span></em></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve learned a lot of important skills over the years by simply watching YouTube videos. YouTube is a great free resource that contains videos and channels dedicated to nearly every topic imaginable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are plenty of great videos from real web developers and programmers who share their personal experiences and give you “insider knowledge” on what you need to know. YouTube also contains many interviews with coders who give their thoughts on finding a job and how they reached professional success. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a great supplement to your core learning, YouTube videos aren’t consistent enough in quality to provide you with a solid education. You’ll also discover many gaps in your knowledge and have trouble finding resources to answer all of the questions that you may have regarding in-depth topics.  </span></p>
<h4><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online Communities</span></em></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joining online forums and groups will help you connect with fellow coders that may be able to guide you in the right direction and provide you with helpful advice for your career. Learning from the experience of others can also help you avoid the same mistakes that they have made and find a smoother path towards success. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you realize it or not, becoming part of a community is also important for developing your confidence and building your identity as a “real” coder. Through interaction with others, you’ll leave behind the imposter syndrome that appears after learning new skills and beginning a new career. As you search for that first job or your dream job, a community will provide you with the support and stability you need to move forward.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By chance, you might even find job openings and opportunities through online communities, as employers often browse the web to find talented programmers. You can also network with fellow programmers and work on projects together, reinforcing that sense of belonging to a community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can often be difficult to find online communities in your own language for coding and programming-related topics. Fortunately, CodeBerry gives you access to an online community with fellow students who speak your language and learn alongside you. </span></p>
<h4><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find a Coding Mentor</span></em></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most valuable resources you can have as a learner isn’t a resource at all, but rather a person. Since they have already gone through the same process, mentors are like gold mines of tips, tricks, and experience. Think of your mentor as your future self who can help you arrive at your goals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll learn from their mistakes and make sense of your own as you talk with your mentor and discuss your progress. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mentors can also help you after graduation by giving you advice on how to find jobs, grow your portfolio, and what to expect in an interview. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12028 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you personally know a programmer or developer, ask them if you can become their apprentice and help them with their daily work. Tasks that might be easy and mundane for a professional could be a great learning experience for you. This way, you’ll gain invaluable insights and experience while providing them with value in exchange for their help.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few websites that can help you find mentors online, such as codementor.io. On Codementor, you’ll be able to find experienced programmers and developers who can give you the guidance you need—at a price. This can be quite costly, as mentors start at about $10 per 15 minutes of advising ($40/hr). We would recommend this option only if you don’t have any personal contacts with programmers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CodeBerry, on the other hand, provides you with a mentor to help you in your coding education journey. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our coding mentors are IT professionals with years of experience in their field. In addition to answering your questions via chat, our mentors help you craft your learning plan, review your code and give suggestions to enhance it, and keep you accountable and committed to your courses. </span></p>
<h4><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Listen to Podcasts</span></em></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The true beauty of podcasts is that they are free, educational, and allow you to learn on the go. When you feel the need to study while you’re stuck in rush hour traffic or commuting on the bus, you can pop in your earphones and listen to some great resources. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because coding is highly visual, audio might not be the best way to learn how to code. However, podcasts will keep you informed of recent updates to programming languages and related technologies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A great coding podcast for beginners is CodeNewbie which discusses the experiences of new coders and how they learned to code, how they landed their first job, etc. Other podcasts like Software Engineering Daily and Coding Blocks cover more technical topics and provide a lot of valuable knowledge for free. </span></p>
<h4><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Books/Resources</span></em></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s nearly impossible to memorize every command in a programming language. Books and other online resources such as W3 Schools provide you with documentation to reference when you need a quick hint or reminder. If you prefer print over digital, there are plenty of great books available on websites like Amazon that provide you with a handy guide to programming languages. For the rest of us, W3 Schools has free guides on their website that will help you as you learn to code.  </span></p>

<h4><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coding Games &amp; Apps </span></em></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to learn how to code and have fun at the same time, coding games and apps are perfect for you. You’ll have so much fun playing these interactive, educational games that you’ll forget that you’re actually learning. Oftentimes, reading books and documents on code can be dry, boring, and a great way to cure sleeplessness. On the other hand, games and apps will keep you interested and engaged, creating the perfect environment for learning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Games such as CodeCombat and CodinGame are extremely fun and help you continue to learn when you feel like your brain is fried after a traditional study session. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://codecombat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">CodeCombat</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a browser-based RPG that allows you to control your character with lines of code. Through this method, you’ll learn languages such as JavaScript and Python without even realizing it. Not to mention, it’s a complete blast to play.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With various lines of code, you’ll make your hero move, attack, and perform certain actions that help you complete each level. As you progress through the levels, you’ll learn important programming concepts such as syntax, arguments, strings, and more. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.codingame.com/start" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">CodinGame</a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is another website that features a wide variety of games that will help you improve your coding skills. CodinGame is much more difficult than CodeCombat and is geared towards those who already have a basic understanding of programming languages. If you are completely new to coding, you might want to try simpler games, such as CodeCombat, first. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personally, it took me a while to just navigate the site and figure out what I should have been doing. After I got adjusted to the layout, I was happily coding away in Python to control my spaceship and fire lasers at alien enemies; it felt pretty good. </span></p>
<h3>Practice &amp; Good Study Habits</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a wise man once said, “Practice makes perfect.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter how many books you read, videos you watch, or the classes you attend, you’ll have to write code frequently to solidify your knowledge. Find projects to work on and create personal goals that cause you to always test your limits and learn new skills. Over time, you’ll find yourself prepared to start your first job. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll also want to have the drive and initiative to teach yourself the skills that you need to know. Self-taught learners tend to make the best programmers since technologies and languages are always changing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In many careers, it’s possible to become an expert in a given topic and feel like you can sit back, relax, and quit growing. As a programmer, you don’t have the luxury of letting your guard down and ceasing to learn new things. The moment that you stop learning is the moment when your knowledge starts to become outdated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team at CodeBerry would like to encourage you to be a lifelong learner and to continuously seek to improve your coding skills.

</ul>
<h2><b>How Do We Define “<a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/how-to-learn-to-code/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Learning to Code</a>”?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, you’ve decided to accept the challenge of learning to code. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As with any long-term investment, you’ve probably considered at least three questions: “How much will it cost?”, “What are the benefits?”, and finally, “How long will it take?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before attempting to calculate how long it takes, we should probably start by asking you a fourth question: “What does it mean to ‘learn how to code’?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some, learning to code may mean knowing how to write a mobile app from scratch, obtaining the skills to land a job as a full-time developer, or simply being able to write basic lines of code for a personal project. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on how you define “knowing how to code”, your timeframe can vary widely. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12017 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><b>The time it takes you to learn to code will also be dependent on a few other factors, such as:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Difficulty of Programming Language </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning Methods</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning Pace &amp; Intensity</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previous Knowledge and Background</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s take a look at how these factors can affect the time it will take you to learn how to code.</span><b> </b></p>
<p><div style="width: 970px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://pixabay.com/hu/photos/laptop-k%C3%A1v%C3%A9-sz%C3%A1m%C3%ADt%C3%B3g%C3%A9pes-4248869/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2019/06/03/12/28/laptop-4248869_960_720.jpg" alt="It’s never too late to learn to code" width="960" height="640" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">It’s never too late to learn to code</p></div></p>
<h2><b>The Programming Language </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not all programming languages were created equal—and that’s actually a good thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While not technically programming languages, HTML and CSS are extremely useful and much easier to learn. Even with just a few weeks of intense study, you can get a really good grasp on these languages and know how to use them at a basic level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Programming languages like JavaScript and Python are considered to be intermediate languages, which require significantly more study and hard work to learn. The good news is that front-end web developers only need to know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, you can start a professional coding career with just two easy-to-learn languages and one intermediate language. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More advanced languages, such as Java and C++, can take many years to learn and a lifetime to master. Even for professional developers with over a decade of experience in these languages, it is still an ongoing process to become a true expert. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many options available to those who want to learn how to code. The most traditional option would be a university program, with coding bootcamps and online schools providing a great alternative. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a university program, you’ll receive an extensive education that covers topics in high-level mathematics, electronics, and more. However, you’ll also spend most of the time learning concepts—not tech skills, necessarily. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll still have to invest your personal time to learn a particular language and it will still take anywhere from 4 to 5 years to graduate with your degree. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, if your main goal is to learn how to program as fast as possible, getting a degree in Computer Science is probably not the right choice for you. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12018 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A popular alternative to taking traditional courses is attending a coding bootcamp. These ultra-intensive programs treat learning how to code like a military bootcamp and try to accelerate the process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They tend to last around 3 months and teach you what you need to know to get your first job. For quick learners with great memory retention, you’ll do great in a coding bootcamp. If you take longer to learn than the average person, however, you might want to look for another option. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This leads us to online courses. Online courses strike a healthy balance between accelerated learning and sustained learning. In English, this means learning at a steady pace that stimulates the brain without overwhelming it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike a university program or coding bootcamp, an online course allows you to take lessons as your schedule—or your brain—allows. To complete an online course, you can expect to take anywhere from 3-6 months. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://pixabay.com/hu/photos/k%C3%B3d-k%C3%B3d-debug-tanulni-4918187/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large" src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2020/03/10/08/22/code-4918187_960_720.jpg" alt="The balance of the regularity and the intensity is really important" width="960" height="720" /></a></p>
<h2><b>Learning Frequency &amp; Intensity</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning how to code is remarkably similar to learning a second language. If you’ve ever had the privilege of learning another language, you may have noticed that the frequency and intensity of your studies affected your learning retention. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studying too much new vocabulary and grammar in one session can overwhelm you and cause you to easily forget what you’ve learned. Studying too little and not getting enough practice, on the other hand, fails to impress the new information upon your mind. This is what we call learning intensity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning frequency refers to how often you study or practice what you’ve learned. Are you taking your coding courses daily, weekly, or monthly? In addition to intense learning sessions, you’ll need to have them frequently to keep your mind fresh. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, maintaining optimal learning frequency and intensity will directly affect how long it takes to learn to code. If the frequency or intensity of your study sessions is too high or too low, you’ll find yourself forgetting what you’ve learned and going over the same material again and again. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This, of course, slows down the learning process. </span></p>
<h2><b>Previous Knowledge and Background</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe it or not, that programming course you took 10 or 20 years ago may actually help you learn to code, today. The human mind has the incredible ability to store up old memories and knowledge that you may have once believed was lost. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To use a personal example, I was able to learn HTML extremely quickly thanks to fundamentals I remembered in a high school course. I hadn’t written HTML in nearly 10 years, but somehow my memory came flooding back when I started typing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve recently learned or are currently using a programming language, those fundamentals will help you learn the next one even quicker. Think back to our example of a second language. If you already know French, learning another Romance language will be significantly easier the second time. </span></p>
<p><div style="width: 970px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://pixabay.com/hu/photos/k%C3%B6nyvek-k%C3%B6nyvespolc-computer-science-942485/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large" src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/09/16/09/47/books-942485_960_720.jpg" alt="Before you start to learn, you have to choose the language what fits you perfectly" width="960" height="654" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Before you start to learn, you have to choose the language what fits you perfectly</p></div></p>
<h2><b>Your Short-Term Goals</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like we mentioned at the beginning of the article, “learning to code” can mean a variety of things. If your goal is to write code for something small like a website for your wedding or a personal project, it may only take you a few weeks to accomplish. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting your first job as a developer, on the other hand, will most likely take you between 150 and 200 hours of practice (3-4 months in an intensive bootcamp).</span></p>
<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A large number of factors go into determining how long it will take you to learn to code. Your personal definition of learning to code, your learning method, your learning intensity and frequency, and your previous experience with coding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As well as providing you with the most flexibility and freedom, online courses strike a balance between the concentrated curriculum of a coding bootcamp and the overly conceptual courses you’ll find in a university program. Online courses allow you to learn at the pace which suits you best. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re learning to code for the first time and have minimal experience, we recommend that you start with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript before moving on to more complex languages. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These will give you the tools with which you’ll be able to build for the web, and then you’ll be on your way to a successful career in programming.</span></p>

</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ve read the articles, searched the web, and done all the research you can on programming. Now, it’s time to finally make the big decision: “what programming language should I learn?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great question. Fortunately for you, we have a step-by-step guide that will help you decide what your motivation is for learning to code and which programming languages you should then learn.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12123 alignright" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/1-683x1024.png" alt="" width="304" height="456" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/1-683x1024.png 683w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/1-200x300.png 200w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/1-768x1152.png 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/1.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 304px) 100vw, 304px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you’re still in the searching stage, this guide should give you some clarity regarding the purpose of the most common programming languages and your preferred niche. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve also identified four distinct ways to rank the top programming languages: by </span><b>popularity</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b>ease-of-learning, earning potential</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><b>usefulness</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disclaimer: In this article, we’ve grouped markup languages, such as HTML and CSS, and scripting languages, such as Bash/Shell and SQL, into the category of programming languages.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start with a list of the top ten most popular programming languages according to <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">StackOverflow</a>:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this list, we see JavaScript, HTML, and CSS taking the top 3 spots for the most popular programming languages. These three languages are the backbone of front-end web development and serve as a great starting point for beginners. SQL is used for database management and the rest, such as Java, Python, C#, PHP, and C++, are general-purpose languages that you can use for a variety of tasks. Bash/Shell, on the other hand, is a command language used to communicate with Unix-based operating systems, like Linux and macOS.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12017 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What about the easiest languages to learn? </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12124 alignleft" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/3-683x1024.png" alt="" width="300" height="450" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/3-683x1024.png 683w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/3-200x300.png 200w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/3-768x1152.png 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/3.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, many of the most popular programming languages are also the easiest to learn. However, we also find some more obscure programming languages, such as R and Erlang. R is a coding language designed for statistical computing and mathematics and is a great tool for data analysis (which we’ll discuss later in the article). Erlang is primarily used for telecommunication and is present in many messaging applications, such as WhatsApp.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;and the top-paying programming languages? </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-12125 alignright" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/5-683x1024.png" alt="" width="314" height="471" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/5-683x1024.png 683w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/5-200x300.png 200w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/5-768x1152.png 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/5.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re new to programming, you probably didn’t recognize many of the languages on this list. Since computer programming is a rapidly evolving industry, the highest-paid skills tend to be related to the newest, most cutting edge technologies. However, knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is enough to get you started in your career—other languages can wait. </span></p>
<h2><b>Overview</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides salary, popularity, and ease of learning, you probably have your own personal motivations to learn a specific programming language. In the area below, we’ll examine some of the determining factors that might help you decide on a programming language and what uses they have. </span></p>
<h2><b>Choosing a Language by Usefulness</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where things get a bit more complicated. How “useful” a language is to you will depend on what you’d like to accomplish with code. For example, HTML and CSS might be extremely useful to a front-end web developer, while Swift and Java are more useful to a mobile developer. Some programming languages, like Python, are designed for general purpose use, but many others are specialized tools that will help you complete specific tasks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, let’s determine why you want to learn to code, decide what area you’d like to focus on, and then find the programming language that is right for you:</span></p>
<h2><b>I Want to Be a Professional Developer</b></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Game Developer</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re passionate about becoming a game developer, there are two main programming languages that you’ll have to master: C++ and C#. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’d like to develop fun, 2D mobile games that are based on community and online interaction, C# is definitely the choice for you. C# is easier to learn and less complicated than C++, making it the main programming language of indie and mobile games. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C++, on the other hand, delivers incredible power and can be used for 3D mobile games and “AAA” titles for PC and console. To create video games with the best performance and the most beautiful graphics, C++ is the way to go. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web Developer</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our article, “<a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/a-brief-introduction-to-programming/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">A Brief Introduction to Programming</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we talked a lot about the big three programming languages for web development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML handles the format, CSS determines the style, and JavaScript makes the page come alive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For web developers who focus primarily on UX (user experience), HTML5 and JavaScript are their most commonly used tools. Web developers involved in e-commerce, however, shift their focus to more advanced languages, such as Java, Ruby, Python, PHP, and C#. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web programmers for small businesses will probably use PHP, while programmers for recent startups use Java, Ruby, and JavaScript for most of their work. Enterprise web developers tend to use C# and Java more often for bigger, Windows-based applications. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile Developer</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile development is a bit more straightforward and only requires you to know one programming language per operating system. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6957" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rami-al-zayat-170349-unsplash-1.jpg" alt="" width="5184" height="3456" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rami-al-zayat-170349-unsplash-1.jpg 5184w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rami-al-zayat-170349-unsplash-1-300x200.jpg 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rami-al-zayat-170349-unsplash-1-768x512.jpg 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rami-al-zayat-170349-unsplash-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/rami-al-zayat-170349-unsplash-1-1080x720.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 5184px) 100vw, 5184px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to create mobile apps for the iPhone or iPad, all you need to know is Swift, Apple’s own programming language for iOS. Introduced in 2014, Swift is a very powerful language that was designed to allow you to program nearly any Apple device. With knowledge of Swift, you can also write applications for Mac, the Apple Watch, and Apple TV!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile development for Android has taken off in recent years and has grown to surpass the popularity of development for iOS. Android is based on Java, making it super easy to learn if you already have experience using the language. You can also go from developing apps for Android to doing a ton of other cool things after you’ve gained the experience in Java. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last, but not least, we come to the Windows phone. The Windows mobile OS runs on C#, one of Microsoft’s very own programming languages. Coding in C# is an extremely valuable skill that any Windows developer should know. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, we are seeing the lines begin to blur as both mobile and desktop become more unified. Rather than being separated by mobile and desktop, programming languages are instead segregated by the ecosystem (Microsoft, Google, and Apple). Google even developed their own language called “Go”, which we might see in the future as a replacement for Java in Android. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Desktop Software</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we mentioned above, the same programming languages that you’ll need for mobile development can be used to develop desktop software as well. If you’re interested in developing software for Windows platforms, you’ll want to learn C#. To develop cross-platform software and programs for Mac, you should learn Java and Swift, respectively. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are also several strong, web-based solutions for developing cross-platform desktop software with just HTML, CSS and JavaScript, such as </span><a href="https://electronjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electron</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12028 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Science</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the field of data science, Python and R are the most useful languages you can learn. Python is like a swiss army knife of programming languages that were designed for general purpose use. However, the strength of Python comes from the vast wealth of free data analysis libraries that are packed full of capabilities. One of the most popular data analysis libraries, Pandas, comes with tools that allow you to import information from spreadsheets or processing sets for time-series analysis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">R is another programming language that is geared towards statistical analysis and graphing. With R, you can include </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">linear and nonlinear modeling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, and more.</span></p>
<h2><b>I Want to Run a Startup</b></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web-based startups have a lot of options when it comes to choosing a programming language. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For e-commerce startups, PHP is a great language to start with. WordPress runs on PHP and is a great starting platform for e-commerce websites.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to start a SaaS (Software as a Service) startup, Java is a necessary language to learn. With Java, you’ll be able to develop software for a huge variety of platforms, from Android to Windows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to the Ruby on Rails framework, Ruby is a powerful, easy-to-use language that makes prototyping a breeze. As a high-level language, you’ll be able to create prototypes quickly and bring your idea to life with minimal effort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, we have JavaScript which directly affects the overall performance of your website. Since your startup is web-based, the performance and user experience is extremely important. These days, search engines like Google will punish you and lower your search results rankings for a slow loading and laggy site. This can make a huge impact on the number of visitors and conversions you receive.</span></p>
<h2><b>I Want to Run a Startup (Version 2.0) </b></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the storefront of an online shop is a website, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will be necessary for the front-end. However, you do have plenty of options for the back-end, which accounts for all of the “behind-the-scenes” operations of your online store. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For handling the back-end, you’ll most likely use Node.js (JavaScript), Ruby, or PHP. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the three, Node.js is the most popular and widely used, both because of its speed and its basis in JavaScript. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since your startup is web-based, the performance and user experience is extremely important. These days, search engines like Google will punish you and lower your search results rankings for a slow loading and laggy site. This can make a huge impact on the amount of visitors and conversions you receive. Therefore, we would recommend the fastest option, Node.js, for the back end. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In extreme cases, you may need to learn Python or R for the back end of your site, but only if you’re dealing with huge amounts of customer or product data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’d like an easier solution that’s already set up for you, try building your e-commerce shop in WordPress, a PHP-based solution. With WordPress, you can use a drag-and-drop interface to construct the façade of your store, while the program takes care of the front end and back end. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although WordPress is relatively easy to use, you’ll still want to learn the language or hire a PHP developer to add any additional features or troubleshoot problems as they arise. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile-based startups like Uber are quite popular and successful at the moment. To launch a startup in the mobile space, it’s important that you create apps that are available on both iPhone and Android. It’s actually possible to develop cross-platform applications in Java using React Native, Ionic, PhoneGap, or Cordova, but it’s recommended that you learn the native programming languages for each platform for the best performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re not able to code it all yourself, hiring a mobile developer that specializes in a specific operating system can be helpful. You’ll need to hire a Java developer for Android, a Swift developer for iOS, a rare talent that may know both, or opt for a cross-platform solution. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Game</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a startup, you likely won’t have the money and resources to develop ‘AAA’ titles like the big studios. Instead, indie developers tend to focus on storyline and creativity when developing games. C++ is complicated, takes time, and is often difficult to use, meaning that it’s not your best choice as a startup. C# is easier to use and will allow you to release games more quickly and on time. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6956" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/gaming-1.jpg" alt="" width="4928" height="3264" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/gaming-1.jpg 4928w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/gaming-1-300x199.jpg 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/gaming-1-768x509.jpg 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/gaming-1-1024x678.jpg 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/gaming-1-1080x715.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 4928px) 100vw, 4928px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web-based games are another great place to start for new game developers. Through HTML5 and JavaScript, you can create incredible games. To find out what kind of games you can develop with HTML5 and JavaScript, check out this article: </span><a href="https://tutorialzine.com/2015/02/30-amazing-games-made-only-with-html5" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://tutorialzine.com/2015/02/30-amazing-games-made-only-with-html5</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if you have the patience, skills, and dedication to create an amazing 3D game, you should learn C++. This powerful programming language from Microsoft is just about all you need to create stunning games for console and PC. </span></p>
<h2><b>I Want to Build Something Fun</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most appealing aspect of programming is not only that it’s useful and highly paid, but also that it can be a lot of fun. If you want to create something cool with coding, you should first consider what kinds of projects interest you. Would you like to create a new mobile app, a web-based game, or even your own AI? Perhaps, you’d like to automate your daily tasks at work or create something for Google Apps (G-Suite)? With a good understanding of the following languages, your imagination will be the only limit to what you can create. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small Games</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t think you need to be a professional programmer to begin following your dream as a game developer; all you need to know is HTML5, JavaScript, and some WebGL. Both Doodle Jump and the incredibly famous (or infamous) mobile game, Flappy Bird, are powered by HTML5 and JavaScript. Sure, you won’t be making ‘AAA’ games for consoles any time soon, but you’ll be surprised by what you can create with limited knowledge of coding. For slightly more advanced games on desktop, you’ll want to utilize languages like C# and Python. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Apps (G-Suite)</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JavaScript is the backbone for creating apps within the Google ecosystem, or the G-Suite, as it is commonly referred to. Google claims that any web apps in the G-Suite can be created with JavaScript and nothing more. This is a bit of an odd claim, considering that Gmail is actually written in Java, not JavaScript. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless, learning</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> JavaScript is not necessary to create apps in G-Suite anymore. Instead, the new Google App Maker gives you a drag-and-drop interface that allows you to create custom applications and provides you with APIs for all of Google’s applications, such as Google Maps and Google Translate. The API, or Application Program Interface, is the key that enables the communication between other Google apps and your own custom app. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Task Automation</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you ever spent countless hours updating a spreadsheet, renaming files, or reorganizing items with your keyboard and mouse? During that mind-numbing experience, did you ever stop to think that there might be a better way? Task Automation is an entire field of programming that is dedicated to automating the boring, mindless tasks that a human would rather not do. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using basic general-purpose languages like Python and Ruby, you can tell your computer to do all of the grunt work for you. Beyond saving time and stress, automating daily tasks will result in more accurate work, since we tend to make mistakes as we get tired, distracted, and bored. Computers, on the other hand, put their heads down and get the work done without fail.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12019 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simple AI (Artificial Intelligence)</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, Python has become increasingly popular in the field of Artificial Intelligence. One of the greatest challenges for software developers of AI is the problem of “deep learning”, which is the ability to learn as a human does. Today, “neural mapping” is a widely-used technique in AI that involves creating large decision-making branches. Each connection is treated as if it were a neuron and a synapse in the brain. Using this technique, researchers in AI hope to create a replica of the brain that reasons and even has the creative capacities like that of a human.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TensorFlow is a great library of resources for Python and other programming languages. While it was primarily developed for use with Python, TensorFlow.js has been released for JavaScript with the intention of using machine learning on the web. In other words, you can even use JavaScript to experiment with AI through the use of TensorFlow. </span></p>
<h2><b>Conclusion </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We hope that you enjoyed our article and now have a clearer idea of which programming language is right for you. Languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the best languages to start with, but you definitely can’t go wrong with a great, multi-purpose language like Python and C#.</span></p>

</ul>
<h3><b>What is programming?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose that you work for a multinational company and you have an upcoming meeting with a businessman from China. Your native language is [insert local language] and you don’t speak a word of Chinese. However, you remember that your second language is English and that the Chinese businessman speaks English as well. You then begin to use English as a common language to negotiate and communicate with each other. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12017 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3><b>What language do computers speak?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A computer’s native language is binary: an incredibly long list of 1’s and 0’s. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Binary</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> isn’t very easy for people to read or write, so we came up with programming languages to talk with computers, instead. Since computers don’t know human languages, we have to meet in the middle somewhere. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, unlike humans, computers aren’t able to pick up on indirect communication and always take things very literally. If you tell them something, they will do it exactly as they are told. Computers aren’t smart enough to make decisions on their own and won’t understand information that isn’t spelt out for them. For this reason, you need to make sure that you’re giving them exact instructions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if I told you to make a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sandwich</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you might ask me what ingredients I want on that sandwich and if I want it toasted or not. To you, that might be all you need to know to make me a delicious sandwich. However, there are many small decisions and previous knowledge involved in making a sandwich. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you simply tell a computer that you want a toasted ham and cheese sandwich with rye bread and mayonnaise, you might get something very different from what you ordered. A human would know that the mayonnaise goes on the slices of bread first, the ham and cheese are added second, then the sandwich is placed in the oven to be toasted. </span></p>
<h3><b>But, how is a computer supposed to know all</b> that?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember that we told the computer that we want, “a toasted ham and cheese sandwich with rye bread and mayonnaise.” To a computer, it might be logical to do all of those things in order. It would toast the ham and cheese by themselves, put two slices of rye bread on top, and then spread mayonnaise on the bread. </span></p>
<h3>Aren’t computers supposed to be smarter than that?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, because the computer takes things</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> literally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you have to specify the order of each step and the placement of each ingredient. Everyone knows that the ingredients go between the pieces of bread, but a computer has no previous knowledge of what a sandwich is like—it’s just following your direct instructions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is another reason why we can’t communicate with computers using human languages, just yet. Our languages are simply too ambiguous and too vague for a computer to understand properly. Also, if a word or a sentence might have a double meaning, a computer wouldn’t know how to interpret it. It needs everything spelt out for it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The truth is that computers aren’t smart at all; they just happen to process information faster than us. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6210" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/code.2-1.jpg" alt="" width="5472" height="3648" /></p>
<h3>What is a programmer and what do they do?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember, you can’t just tell the computer in English what you want. You’ll need a computer programmer to translate for you. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A computer programmer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a person who communicates your ideas and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">instructions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to a computer, making websites, games, and other programs appear on the screen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A programmer could also be defined as a polyglot (one who knows many languages) that specializes in talking to computers. They know exactly what to say and how to say it so that the computer will understand them. If you’ve ever learned another language, you know that each language comes with its own vocabulary, grammar, and set of rules. Computer languages also come with their own way of saying things, called syntax. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a person might understand you if you </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mispronounce</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a word, use the wrong conjugation, or mess up your grammar, a computer is a lot less forgiving with mistakes. As soon as you make a syntax error, the computer will stop listening to you and quit running the program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How rude. </span></p>
<h3>What are you able to accomplish with coding skills?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve ever used a computer, watched videos online, or played video games, it might be hard to believe that all of that comes from just a series of letters and symbols. The ability to process thousands of lines of code per second is the strength of a computer and allows it to follow highly complex instructions and accomplish incredible tasks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s take a look at some of the cool things you can do with code:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create &amp; Design Websites</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Build Mobile Apps</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Develop Desktop Programs</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Develop Video Games</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create &amp; Maintain Databases</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automate Tasks</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solve Complex Problems</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create Artificial Intelligence</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perform Statistical Analysis</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And much more&#8230;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re interested in any of these activities and would like to do them for a living, learning to program is definitely an important skill to have. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12028 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3>What makes coding useful and what is it good for?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we rely more and more on computers in our daily lives, the importance of computer programming and coding continues to grow as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the coming years, nearly all fields will involve computer programming and learning to code will give you an edge in your future career. For example, you can use programming skills in the areas of writing, analysis, management, engineering, software development, and so much more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advocates of programming see learning to code as a universal skill that everyone should have, such as the ability to read and write or perform simple mathematical equations. Many governments around the world believe this as well and have proposed initiatives to teach coding to kids alongside core curriculum in schools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like us, they see coding as the key to staying competitive in a global marketplace. </span></p>
<h3>I already know it’s useful, but what is programming actually like?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average day in the life of a programmer isn’t as glamorous as it might appear in movies or on television shows. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being a programmer requires a lot of concentration, patience, and a self-driven attitude. If you aren’t able to sit down and focus for hours at a time, you might want to reconsider pursuing a career in computer programming. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some programming jobs may require you to work on an irregular schedule and be available to fix bugs and solve problems immediately as they appear. Others may have you work from nine to five o’clock, just like a regular job. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, working as a computer programmer might give you more freedom than your current job allows. A good number of programming jobs are remote, meaning that you can code while at home, at a café, or while you get a tan at the beach—given that the wifi signal reaches that far. </span></p>
<h3>Is programming really right for me?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where the rubber meets the road and where you’ll have to seriously weigh the computer programmer pros and cons. Perhaps, you’ve had an unrealistic idea of what programming is like and haven’t considered that coding is just like any other job out there—it’s still hard work. However, if you meet the following criteria, chances are that you’ll love every second of it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Signs that Programming Isn’t Right for You:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are only motivated by money and aren’t interested in computers at all</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t like to sit down for long periods of time</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your eyes glaze over when you look at a page of code</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are relatively slow at typing and often make many typos</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Signs that Programming IS Right For You:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You describe yourself as both analytical AND creative</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have high attention to detail</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are comfortable working with others and working alone</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have a good basis for understanding written English</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You love problem-solving</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You love to always learn new things</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You adapt well to change</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You like to organize information and automate processes</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>What programming languages do I choose and where do I start?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s go back to the example of our meeting with the Chinese businessman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although English may be useful in a business setting, you might find that you need to learn other languages for different fields. For example, you might want to know French for diplomacy, Greek for philosophy, and German in the field of engineering. Depending on what field you work in, you will choose a specific language to meet your needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You won’t have the time or ability to learn every programming language out there, so you’ll need to be strategic about what languages you will learn. First, you need to determine what your focus is and what languages you need to know to accomplish your personal goals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While technically not programming languages, HTML and CSS are great languages to start with to begin learning the fundamentals of how programming works. HTML and CSS are “text markup languages” which are actually languages that we use to format and organize the text. Without HTML or CSS, your browser wouldn’t know if these words I’m writing are a headline, a paragraph, or a footer. It also wouldn’t know if these words should be bolded, italicized, etc. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even as I write this article, I am using HTML and CSS to help you and your internet browser understand what I have to say. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12019 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3>TL;DR (Too Long; Didn’t Read)</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In summary, programming is a high-paying career that requires patience, dedication, and extremely high attention to detail. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you hate sitting down at a computer and aren’t willing to put in the time to practice, you’ll likely hate programming and give up rather quickly. You also won’t do well if you are motivated by the paycheck and have no interest in the job itself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if you love learning new things, are self-motivated, and have a can-do attitude, you’ll succeed—regardless of your educational background.</span></p>
