										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People disagree whether it is possible and worth it to learn the basics of programming or programming languages from books or not, and about which books are the best for these purposes. We believe that well-written programming books can be a good foundation and give learning support if we also practice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal of this blog post is to help you orient yourself in the world of books about programming languages or other programming subtopics and guide you with information about what to look for when choosing a programming book, where to find them, and how to use them efficiently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the second half of the article, you can find book recommendations sorted by programming languages and technologies (e.g., programming, web development). In the list, you will find physical books, online textbooks, and a few university notes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step Zero – If you aren’t yet sure where to go</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might already know what you want to learn within the huge topic of programming—what languages, what technologies you would like to get to know. But you might also be a beginner, not knowing where to start. This is why we wrote another article titled </span><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/which-programming-language-is-right-for-you/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which Programming Language is Right for You?</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You should read this blog post before starting to learn. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a nutshell, you should choose a language according to your goals, what you would like to use programming for, or what other languages you want to get to know.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to choose appropriate programming books</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to know what your current goal is when learning. Do you want to prepare for exams? Do you want to know the basic concepts and logical operations of programming? Do you already have programming skills and want to learn a new language? Make your goal clear, and look for programming books according to it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you know if a book you want to absorb is good? You cannot be sure about it before you start, but some things can help you decide. Look through the table of contents to see the book’s topics, and know if it contains the key information you need. As an absolute beginner, it can be difficult to judge what a book needs to be useful when learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read a bit of the book! Look through some chapters, and see whether the text is well-structured and understandable. It is essential for you to be able to follow the text, and for the text to make sense of definitions, not be superficial, but not to be too stressful to read either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">See whether the book gives any examples as well as explanations. We can grasp complex concepts easier with examples than with just a description.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to practice to be successful in learning. It is great if a book has practice tasks with explanations and sample pieces of code.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, you can read reviews and ask people about the books in forums and other programming groups. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where and how can I get programming books?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer might be obvious that you can find books like this in bookstores and online, but let’s see what other options we have if we want to get them cheaper or in a more sustainable way. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Used books</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We spare our environment and our wallets if we don’t buy books fresh from the press. Why would it be a problem if someone else read it before us? The virtual and actual shelves of second-hand bookstores have things other than old books; There are many newer books as well, so it can be useful to start your search in these second-hand bookstores. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some other groups and websites are also worth checking out, as many people want to sell their textbooks when they are finished learning from them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you rent a book from the library, you should be aware that the rental time can be short, making us pressed for time. This can have its advantages, giving us external motivation to read faster. However, we might need the book later, or the learning process can be longer than the book’s rental time.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bookstores and publishers</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can’t always buy straight from publishers, but some have their own online stores where you can get their books at a discounted price. On the list at the end of this article, you can find links to publishers’ online stores when they are available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are buying programming books at a bookstore, you can look through them, which can be an important aspect if you are unsure about which book you want to choose. Bookstores have a limited storage capacity, so not all books they have are on the shelves. Find out if the books you are looking for can be bought at the store or not.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you don’t even have to buy them</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many university notes, PDFs from authors, and complete textbooks available on the internet for free. On the list at the end of this article, we’ll tell you if the recommended text is available online or not. We cannot always find the most recently published editions, but if you want to learn about the basics of programming, algorithms, or programming logic, they can be helpful.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn efficiently from programming books</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do you need to be able to learn programming from books? Besides finding the right book for your level, interests, and goals, practising what you read is also crucial. You can be efficient only if you code.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have questions you need answers to. Reading programming books this way can keep you interested while searching for answers, so you’ll have a richer learning experience than reading from cover to cover. Without real programming and persistent practice, we forget processes even if we understand them while reading. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open the programming environment recommended by the book, and complete the steps and tasks written in it.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advantages and Difficulties </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every learning form has its own advantages, and there are always some difficulties that need to be overcome as well. There are different needs to be met if you want to get to know a programming language from the basics, or if you want to prepare for an exam.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>In this article, we’ll talk about the advantages and disadvantages of</strong> learning programming with <strong>private mentorship and online courses.</strong> We’ll also touch on the important roles of mentors and learning communities.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Private Programming Tutor </span></h3>
<p><div style="width: 298px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4339796/pexels-photo-4339796.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;h=750&amp;w=1260" alt="Mentorship has several advantages if you like to learn on your own pace." width="288" height="432" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Credit: <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/man-love-people-woman-4339796/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Pexels</a></p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An undeniable advantage of having a tutor is that<strong> they can help us advance, guide our learning experience, and we don’t have to rely only on our self-discipline.</strong> This means it is not only on our diligence to learn to program—we also have to respect another person’s time and efforts. There is a prearranged schedule to meet online or in person, and most people probably find it easier to learn this way than if they have to find time for it themselves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many ways to learn independently as well, and you don’t need to have social contacts for some of them. For those who need social interactions, having a tutor can be a fantastic choice. <strong>Most people choose online education, so they can form social connections but don’t have to be in the same place physically.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a tutor can also provide you with a completely<strong> customized learning experience,</strong> while courses aren’t customized to our personal tastes. A tutor can also notice and make up for some gaps in your knowledge that you might not even notice.</span></p>
<p><strong>Tutors can go back to the basics if need be, can teach you mathematical and logical skills that are not in the curriculum, and they can help you develop your English skills as well.</strong></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online Programming courses</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Things that some people find helpful, others find difficult—in the case of tutoring, it can be difficult for some to adjust to a specific schedule. If someone’s schedule is always changing, private tutoring can be hard to manage. In this case, individual learning can be the solution as it is much more flexible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a course is based on continuous feedback, like </span><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CodeBerry’s courses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you don’t have to wait for a teacher to give you feedback or wait a whole week for someone to check your home assignments—<strong>you get immediate feedback on your skills and progress.</strong> With courses in which <strong>you can practice your newly learned skills</strong> and answer questions about what you learned, you’ll immediately catch on if you misunderstood something, meaning you can learn the correct information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With an online course, <strong>you get a curriculum you can always access,</strong> <strong>explanations that are always there,</strong> while a tutor’s explanations only stay with you if you write them down. During learning, it can be really helpful to go back to a definition and read it again if you forgot it</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mentorship</span></h4>
<p><div style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4144923/pexels-photo-4144923.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;dpr=2&amp;h=650&amp;w=940" alt="" width="400" height="267" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Credit: <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/person-writing-on-notebook-4144923/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Pexels</a></p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, a <strong>mentor can help you when you get stuck and give you customized explanations, just like a private tutor.</strong> Mentors are more “energy, time and cost-efficient” than a tutor because they only help when you actually need help. You don’t have to work together on materials you can learn alone. If there are some things you already know and understand, you can complete them independently, fast. <strong>A mentor is a teacher you can call whenever you need them, but they won’t stand over your shoulder during the whole learning process.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On advanced levels, where you need to complete complex individual tasks or create projects, <strong>mentors can check your work, help you improve with their suggestions, and recommend changes</strong> that you might find helpful.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online Learning Community</span></h4>
<p><strong>Having an online learning community like at <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/hu" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">CodeBerry’s courses</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> can give you the motivation</strong> to get through the harder tasks with your fellow students and can also give you support and encouragement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond community cohesion, a very important benefit of communicating with fellow students is the <strong>opportunity to learn from each other.</strong> You can learn from the questions asked and answered by others, but you can also answer your fellow students’ questions. The latter is important because we need to organize our thoughts when we try to explain things, so <strong>we can deepen our knowledge by helping others.</strong></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">What About Prices? </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Different learning forms have different advantages, but how much do we need to spend to get these advantages? Independent progress doesn’t cost that much, and we collected some awesome tips for you in our article titled </span><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/hu/programozas-ingyen/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4+1 simple ways to learn programming for free</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to learn with a<strong> private tutor,</strong> you have to spend a bit more. <strong>Hourly rates start from 10-12 dollars,</strong> but the average is $20 per hour. However, there are even pricier options as well. For some tutors, you have to pay $40 for 60 minutes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Programming courses</strong> offer you other financial constructs so their prices differ significantly. An hour <strong>can cost anywhere between $5 and $12</strong>, but there are courses that are more costly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>At CodeBerry, an hour costs less than $4</strong> if we are counting 5 hours per week for our three-month courses.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where Can We Find Private Tutors?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook seems to be an obvious choice, we can ask our friends to introduce the mysteries of programming to us. <strong>There are also groups on </strong></span><strong>Facebook, where you can search for private tutors:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/521438201822480/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Private tutor</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/943457715686804/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online tutors</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1177842622291932/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tutor needed</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p><b>There are also websites with private tutoring ads</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">—we just have to type “programming” into a search engine, and we can look at everything on offer. Here are the best ones:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://spires.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spires</span></a></li>

</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Programming With Private Tutors or Programming Courses? Which is More Effective?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to answer this, <strong>we have to know our own learning style</strong> and think through our situation. If we want to prepare for an exam or a job interview, or if we want to get answers to specific questions, a private tutor might be the better choice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>If you want to learn a new programming language</strong> or the basics of programming through practice,<strong> a course can also be a great choice.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, we don’t have to worry about the effectiveness of online courses that require individual learning over on-site courses if we have some self-discipline and can concentrate on our tasks to progress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you get properly created, easy to follow learning materials, you won’t be less effective learning at home than on-site, and this has been proven by a </span><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/jeductechsoci.19.4.59.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">scientific study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as well. In the experiment, a group learned Java programming in a traditional classroom environment, while another group learned with the help of tutorial videos with screen recordings of the programming interface combined with short explanations. The group that learned individually did better during the experiment than the group that learned on-site.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Much Are My Programming Skills Worth if I Didn’t Get Them at a University?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we look at the trends of today, we can answer the question above with the following: they are worth more and more. There are many programming job offers that don’t need an engineering degree. Most of the time, it is enough for you to do well during tasks in the entrance exam and having convincing references. Where you got your programming skills is not as important.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>We can learn programming with courses, bootcamps, or even individually.</strong> If our knowledge is sound and we have enough experience, we have a good chance when applying for most any job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the statistics of the programming forums at Stack Overflow,<strong> almost 30% of programmers don’t have a university degree.</strong> Another interesting fact is that those with <strong>a degree don’t always get their diploma in IT areas: almost 40% have a degree in other fields.</strong></span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_11143" style="width: 905px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11143" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-11143 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/stat.png" alt="" width="895" height="537" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/stat.png 895w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/stat-300x180.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/stat-768x461.png 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/stat-627x376.png 627w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/stat-440x264.png 440w" sizes="(max-width: 895px) 100vw, 895px" /><p id="caption-attachment-11143" class="wp-caption-text">Credit: Stack Overflow Insights &#8211; Developer survey</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One motto of today is <strong>lifelong learning.</strong> It is not an empty phrase, but a crucial feature of programmers. Nothing represents this more than the diagram above that shows convincing data about the popularity and success of individual learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">86,8% of people learned a programming language, framework, or tool by themselves. 60,1% of them took online courses in programming or software development.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you want to learn one of the most popular programming languages that make finding a job a child&#8217;s play? Do you want employers to chase after you with the best jobs?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get a firm grasp of one (or more) of the programming languages below, and if your knowledge stands on firm grounds, we bet you will find a job quickly, and your programming skills will be compensated with a high salary.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the most popular programming languages?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world of technology is ever-changing, so the list of the most popular programming languages changes too:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are languages that seem like they can never be removed from the top 10 (e.g., Java, Python, JavaScript, SQL). </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, we noticed some trends in popularity—some technologies are used less and less (e.g., PHP) while others are used more widely (e.g., JavaScript).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They are also always creating new languages and technologies to solve the tasks of a particular area even more efficiently (e.g., R).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ones higher on the list of the most popular programming languages are general-purpose languages with a long history (like Java), but there are newer ones on the top 10 list as well, that have been developed for more special purposes (like R and MATLAB).</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we based our list on the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summaries of international trends: </span><a href="https://go.courses/blog/all-the-programming-languages-worth-learning-in-2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go Courses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://medium.com/@satyanageshan8/the-7-most-used-programming-languages-in-2019-and-2020-predictions-29c715c3f456" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">medium.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://hackr.io/blog/best-programming-languages-to-learn-2020-jobs-future" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hackr.io</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stackoverflow Developer Survey</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also looked at job-posting websites to see how many ads contain the programming languages below. In our article, we used the numbers of the website </span><a href="https://hu.indeed.com/jobs?q=java&amp;l=Hungary" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, since that is a meta job-posting site, meaning they compile the jobs from many other job sites. The numbers were accurate during the writing of this article, but job offers always change somewhat, of course.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Java</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Write Once, Run Anywhere”. This is what gives Java its popularity since programs written in this language can be run on any compatible device without recompiling them if Java has been installed. It is a general-purpose language that has versatile uses, like website development, or creating mobile and desktop applications. There are other Java versions available for corporate servers and other business applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also have to mention that Android is Java-based, there are many Java applications for Windows, and the corporate world and back-end programming also build heavily on this language, adding to the wide variety of job options.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 1038 Java-based programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to read more:</span></h5>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our </span><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/hu/java-programozas-tanfolyam-1" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Java programming course</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is for you if you want to learn the basics of programming with this language that can be used in many ways</span></li>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Python</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is an easily readable, general-purpose language with an easy syntax. We can recommend this to beginners as well since Python is one of the most suitable programming languages to start learning the basics of programming. It stands on or near the top of the lists of the most popular, the most well-liked by programmers, and the easiest to learn programming languages, and has been on top for years now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine learning and AI development are the fastest developing areas of use for Python. It is also the most often used language in data science, but it isn’t unknown in the world of web programming and game development either.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 740 Python programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article.</span></p>

</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">JavaScript </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is mostly a language of websites. It is used primarily for front-end development, as this language makes most websites more interactive and dynamic, but it is starting to gain popularity on the server-side as well, with the help of the software system Node.js.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All steps of web development, and prior to that, UI and UX design (meaning the creation of user-friendly, good-looking and modern websites) have a great value on the labour market—we always need web developers. You can’t go wrong with this knowledge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 651 JavaScript programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article. </span></p>

</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">One step forward: TypeScript </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TypeScript is a scripting language created by Microsoft. The goal of developing it wasn’t the creation of another rival language, but making a tool that expands the possibilities of JavaScript so that we can do massive projects with it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 172 programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article that requires TypeScript skills or lists them as an advantage.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">C# </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With C#, we can create desktop, mobile, and web-based applications, and with the .NET framework makes it even easier to develop things for tools created by Microsoft and the Windows operating system. This framework has fused together with C# almost completely, they are usually mentioned together, and job offers generally require you to know the framework as well as the language.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are other software development platforms for C#, e.g., Unity, which has been created for game development and has since become the engine for many known games.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C# can also be suitable for writing websites and web applications using the ASP.NET framework.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C# can be used independently from Microsoft—you can write software for Xbox, Android, macOS and many more platforms.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 434 C# programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">SQL</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Structured Query Language is the standard language for data management. In our data-centric world, databases that store and process huge amounts of data are indispensable parts of our tools and services’ background processes. Experts who can create and manage databases like this are in high demand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning SQL is a worthy investment, and if you also have some other programming, data analysis, or data visualization skills, you can have a job basically anywhere since, as we have mentioned before, databases are needed everywhere.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 1300 programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article that requires SQL skills. </span></p>

<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12028 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">C++</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a low-level, close-to-hardware programming language that is hard to read and it is the upgraded version of the widely used C language, which is the basis for many systems. Learning this language requires strong IT and mathematical skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This language usually isn’t recommended for beginners, but this article is about programming languages that can help you find a job, and C++ certainly is one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can be used to create and fine-tune operating systems, device drivers, video games, and even desktop and mobile apps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are not a beginner, or if you are looking for long-term goals, C++ can be an amazing choice since C++ skills are valuable on the labour market. Corporations need highly-trained C++ developers who can complete especially complex and serious programming tasks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This valuable knowledge is compensated with a high salary, and senior C++ developers are among the most well-paid programmers. As newer and newer programming languages start to appear that are easier to use, the number of C++ developers are decreasing, so you are almost guaranteed a job if you are capable of working professionally in this complex language</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 362 C++ programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article.</span></p>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">PHP</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a scripting language used in web development and database management that is relatively easy to learn, and there are good and well-paid opportunities for it from the very beginning. It is popular and in high demand because one of the most popular website creation applications, WordPress, is running in PHP as well. In 2018, 83.5% of websites choose PHP as their server-side programming language, including such tech giants as Facebook, Tumblr or Slack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web developers, and more specifically, back-end or full-stack developers have many job options if they know and use PHP confidently.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">R</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">R is a field-specific programming language, used mostly for statistical analyses and the representation of their results. Nowadays, data science is a highly important and dynamically expanding area, so there are many job offers for writing statistical software and data analysis. R also plays a role in machine learning, which is also an important area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since statistical analysis is used in many fields—sciences and human research, commerce, marketing, and meteorology to name a few, R programming skills can be crucial for us not just as members of development teams, but for research groups and other things as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the infinite amount of data we are working within the 21st century, experts in data analysis and exploring correlations are becoming indispensable. So people can be sure that they will find positions in which they can make use of their R skills.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perl</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previously, the most important language of the web had been Perl, also called “The Duct Tape of the Internet.” Today, other languages have gained considerable ground, but Perl is still a widely used general-purpose language.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They use Perl in system administration, programming networks, creating graphical user interfaces, and, of course, web development is also still on the table.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 129 Perl programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">MATLAB programming language</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lists of most popular programming languages are created using different criteria, but if we are looking at which languages are in high demand on the labour market, MatLab appears on more and more of them. MatLab is both the name of the development environment and the programming language used in that environment. It has been developed mostly for performing technical calculations, developing and testing algorithms, and creating simulations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is often used for a visual representation of scientific test results and data processing tasks. If you already have high mathematical skills or knowledge of some field of science, MatLab can become a valuable asset.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swift </span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swift is a general-purpose, high-level programming language developed by Apple. It can be used to write programs for macOS, iOS or other Apple operating systems. It has many modern features that make development easier and more secure. It stands out from other programming languages for the same purpose in that programs are written in Swift run extremely quickly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The importance of Apple is unquestionable in the world of IT, so even if Swift isn’t one of the most popular programming languages yet, it is quickly rising, and you can already find a lot of jobs if you know it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 75 Swift programming jobs on Indeed during the writing of this article.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The terms remote work and home office can be heard and read more and more frequently. But what do they actually mean if we try to look under the surface and put aside our associations? What opportunities arise if we choose to work from home, and what situations can it solve?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we’ll look at remote job opportunities, and why many people choose this lifestyle. We will also talk about how we can find a new profession if we want to work from home. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also read my personal story about how I came to work at home and what experiences I have about working at a company where every coworker works remotely.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remote work &#8211; what do we mean by that?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before I tell you my story, let’s take a look at what remote work is. Let’s separate work you have to take home out of necessity or the work people must do at home, and just talk about people who can decide where they want to work under the right conditions and choose to work at home.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The spring of 2020, and the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on our working habits</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strict measures have been introduced in many parts of the world over the outbreak of the COVID epidemic, which has included restrictions on leaving home and a firm recommendation that whoever can do their job from home should do that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of people experienced the advantages and disadvantages of remote work this way—not under ideal conditions. This sudden change caused them anxiety, with their employers being unprepared, and kids learning from home. The change was felt in many ways; some experienced only the positive side of working from home, while others wanted nothing more than to be able to go to their workplaces again.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Temporary home office or long-term remote work?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is good practice to separate temporary home offices from long-term, well-organized remote work, since ideally, this is not a form of work that most people want to escape from. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By home office, we mean when an employee stays a few days (or more, because of the coronavirus situation) at home, but can be reached during her working hours, uses company equipment, and does office work from home. We might think this is convenient, because we don’t have to go to work in the morning, and can complete our tasks from the comfort of our home, on our couch, maybe even in pyjamas. This may not be optimal for everyone, but this article is not about their work efficiency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others may think about remote work as work that they “bring home”, which invades their privacy, making it difficult for them to have a family meal, or free time on the weekend without worrying about their jobs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To us, long-term remote work means much more. We create conditions that let us work efficiently and pleasantly from home. This can apply to many professions and jobs: you can be an entrepreneur, a freelancer or even an employee who chooses to make their home their workplace. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who works remotely, and why?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well-organized remote work can be an ideal choice in many situations. It can help those who don’t get any job offers near their home. Commuting daily can be exhausting, expensive, and time-consuming, so remote work seems ideal in these situations in many aspects.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">People who can’t get to their workplaces easily</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some people choose remote work because of their </span><b>disability</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><b>other health reasons</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some families work from home while bringing up children to be able to create a more stable financial situation and a </span><b>balanced family life</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">People who live far from cities</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of people leave their past in the city behind and </span><b>start a new life in the countryside</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, far from all the noise and traffic. This doesn’t mean they have to give up their old jobs if they can be done remotely. Of course, for most people, moving to a new place means changing their lifestyle, </span><b>starting a new profession,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and leaving their old one. But if they want to make sure that they have income, remote work can be a great choice if they have a valuable, sought-after job.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital nomads—the “I-always-work-from-wherever” lifestyle</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new lifestyle started to take hold of people in the 21st century, called the </span><b>“digital nomad”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lifestyle. People who choose to live this way are always on the road exploring the world while working remotely. They only need a laptop and a reliable internet connection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the </span><a href="https://www.adventurouskate.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website of Adventurous Kate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can follow her adventures around the world since 2010. Her business is built up around this idea as well—she teaches women (remotely, of course) about how they can travel safely. There is also </span><a href="https://digitalisnomad.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a Hungarian digital nomad blog</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, if you are interested in the pros and cons of this travelling-while-working lifestyle of an English teacher.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And </span><a href="https://www.digitalnomadsoul.com/digital-nomad-blogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here are 31 exciting blogs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if you want to learn even more about the digital nomad lifestyle.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What work can be done from home? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The spectrum is wider than we would think at first, and the list of opportunities always gets longer. Big, international companies started to offer partially or fully remote jobs. On job-seeking platforms (like LinkedIn), you can </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?keywords=remote" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filter for remote work,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and there are sites that specialize in remote work exclusively, for example, </span><a href="https://weworkremotely.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We work remotely</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of creative work (graphic designer, photographer, video editor, copywriter, designer, etc.) can be done remotely. In a corporate environment, there are countless positions where keeping in contact is the only condition, meaning you don’t have to be present in person. These jobs can also be remote work if the operation of the company allows it e.g., in the HR area, in customer services, as consultants, in the marketing area, as contact people, or as a salesman, etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the IT field, most tasks can be completed from home, in software and web development, UX design, data science or any other specialization if the structure of the company and the ways of communication allow it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Occasional jobs can also be done remotely, like translation, data recording and opinion polling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a profession, skill or talent that you could use to start a business or work as a freelancer for other companies, you can also try creating the perfect work environment at your home. </span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">My experience with remote work</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">From interpreter to copywriter</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the spring of 2020, I couldn’t continue working as I had been, as a freelancer, which had been my main source of income due to the coronavirus outbreak. I was working as an interpreter, and due to the mandatory shutdown, the number of my orders decreased.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had to find a new job, so I applied for many positions where I could work remotely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was important for me that the job I apply to gives me a bit of flexibility since I wanted to do my own work schedule so that I could continue my occasional interpreting jobs as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At CodeBerry Programming School, I found the opportunity to have a constant, reliable source of income while working on exciting and creative processes and still having time for other important things in my life. At this company, a hundred percent of the work is done remotely. Every coworker works from home, joining this dynamically and smoothly operating team from all over the world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12028 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do people communicate with each other at a company that works completely remotely?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communication and project management within the company happens with the help of a few pieces of software that had been developed to handle exactly these tasks. We use the chat application Slack to keep in touch instead of emails, and we create channels for each work team, for reporting bugs and other technical problems, for program organization, etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We use </span><a href="https://basecamp.com/welcome-back" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basecamp</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to follow up on project planning and scheduling, and we get to look at the work of other teams there as well. We also see the events of the week and our tasks for the next week on Basecamp, and we plan things in 6 + 2-week-long project cycles. We follow the completion of each subtask on </span><a href="https://trello.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trello</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meetings are held on </span><a href="https://zoom.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoom</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and we handle documents on Google interfaces that can be edited together (like Docs and Sheets). Every file (e.g., meeting notes, articles, spreadsheets, notes) can be accessed by all coworkers.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pros and cons of working from home – a subjective viewpoint</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most positive thing about remote work for me is that I can choose the time when I want to work, and can adjust it week-by-week if necessary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be efficient, I always plan ahead and mark exactly when I will do my tasks—in the morning, the whole day, at night, or maybe on the weekend, and I mark when I have other activities. If the next season or situation requires some other schedule, I can adjust it as much as I like.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a great advantage for me that I am not tied down to a place, so I can work from abroad, from the countryside, from the capital, from a library, a café or an office, or from home. This gives me great security, so I don’t have to worry about how I can get to work if something changes (if I move, for example). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By choosing remote work, a few things fundamentally changed in my everyday life. I spend less time traveling, so I can spend that valuable time on something else, and I don’t even have to stress about being late and being in crowds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, we have to struggle with the decrease in human relationships, and we have to find other ways of connection since we don’t see our colleagues much, even through a screen, when we work from home. To have a good workplace environment, we need to talk, laugh and eat together. We need to find these impulses elsewhere when we work remotely. This might help you focus on your work, but can cause problems for people who need the company.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning remotely is also worth it</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to improve yourself or want to change your profession, you have many opportunities to train yourself further. Learn, practice new skills or make your hobby your profession. Find what you are talented in, and what you would like to do as a job. If you want to work remotely in the long-term, acquire skills that can make it possible for you.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal of this article is to give you an idea about what each specialist like programmer, software developer or software engineer does within the IT world. To show what their main tasks are, and what the differences and similarities are between them. We’d like to present you with a comprehensive summary that will clarify some commonly used expressions to those who are not yet familiar with this area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to emphasize that in many cases there are no clear lines drawn between individual roles, it can also depend on a given company, on expertise or on an order who has to perform what tasks exactly.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12017 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the difference between a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">programmer</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a <em>software</em> </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">developer</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In everyday use, the two terms are practically interchangeable, and we can even add the term </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">coding</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> next to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">programming</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">development</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The words </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">programmer</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">developer</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">coder</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can also be used interchangeably in most contexts. They all describe the same knowledge and role—somebody who uses programming languages to create commands that computers can understand, through which software can be made. </span></p>
<h3>What exactly a software developer does?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And although in everyday use they mean the same thing, some employers might differentiate what they mean by a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">software developer</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">programmer</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some people think software development is a more comprehensive design task with high-level decision-making (e.g., the software developer designs the database or how data moves between the parts of more complex software), while by programming, they usually mean writing lines of code based on the guidelines of designers (e.g. fixing a drop-down menu that was displayed incorrectly, or writing a function with a specific output and input).</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the difference between a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">software engineer</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">programmer</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software Engineer</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> always has an engineering degree, i.e. a university degree with at least a BSc level in the field of informatics (engineering informatics, program design informatics, etc.). Their tasks and role are determined by the given company, but it needs to be a programming position for someone with a university degree in all cases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In university, the theoretical and mathematical bases of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Computer Science</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are taught more prominently with less focus on programming practice. As a software engineer, you need to have a firm grasp of the theoretical side of development (e.g., designing data structures, the efficacy of algorithms) and the practical execution as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a company is not looking for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">software engineers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">programmers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">software developers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, having a degree may not be an entry requirement – it is very possible that the programming skills you acquired during courses and through individual learning will be enough to get the job. Of course, fast learning and the openness to acquiring new skills are essential.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the difference between a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">web designer</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">web developer</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to create a nice, well-functioning website, different kinds of experts need to be involved. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Designers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are responsible for the visual design and feel of a website, while </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">web designers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are responsible for the look. Web designers use graphic design software (e.g., Photoshop, Illustrator, Sketch).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They need to understand colour theory and typography, and other graphic skills might be useful, such as vector graphics or basic typographic knowledge (since the website and the printed materials usually look the same, it is useful to know how the things on the screen will look on paper).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to know the basic structure of websites, and it can come in handy for a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">web designer</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be familiar with the basics of HTML and CSS so that the languages of site-building don’t seem alien to them. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web designers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, however, are (usually) not programmers—they are responsible for only the visual aspects of a site.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web developers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are the ones that create and maintain a website using <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/introduction-to-web-development/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">web programming languages</a> (e.g., HTML, CCS, <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/beginners-guide-to-javascript/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">JavaScript</a> or, depending on the tasks, <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/introduction-java-programming-language/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Java</a>, <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/beginners-guide-to-python-programming/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Python</a>, <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/beginners-guide-to-php-programming/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">PHP</a>, SQL etc.). Unlike </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">designers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">web developers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are programmers who write the code that is needed to run a website.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the difference between </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">UI</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">UX designers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When designing a UI (user interface), the designer has to take users needs and the look of the brand into account. A </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">UI designer</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> creates the visual aspects of the interface—like colours, illustrations, buttons, etc.—using mostly graphic software to do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When designing UX (user experience), </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">UX designers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> need to assess user needs accurately, so they create interviews and ask for feedback from users. Based on this information, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">UX designers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> create the structure, the menu, the navigation and other parts of a website. They use software that has been created to design and optimize the user experience.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the difference between front-end, back-end and full-stack developers?</span></h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Front-end</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, also known as the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">client-side</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the part of the website that we see: the buttons, the images, the texts and the interaction—every program that runs in the client (the browser). People who create the interface (the front-end) of a website or mobile/web applications and everything that users see and interact with are called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">front-end developers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. During web projects, they usually work in HTML, CSS and <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/beginners-guide-to-javascript/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">JavaScript</a>, but sometimes they use <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/beginners-guide-to-javascript/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">JavaScript</a> frameworks (e.g., React, AngularJS, Vue.js) as well.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back-end</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, also known as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">server-side</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the part of a website we don’t see: saving and loading data from databases, performing calculations, serving requests from the client, providing API endpoints—in short, it’s every program that runs on the server. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back-end developers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, also called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">server-side programmers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are working on the back-end. The most frequently used server-side languages are <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/beginners-guide-to-python-programming/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Python</a> programming language, Node.js, <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/beginners-guide-to-php-programming/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">PHP</a> and <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/introduction-java-programming-language/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Java</a>.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full-stack developers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are developers that can program on both the client-side and the server-side.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the difference between a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">system administrator</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">DevOps engineer</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">?</span></h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">System administrators</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, also known as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">sysadmins</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (sometimes capitalized like SysAdmins) are responsible for the maintenance and reliable operation of servers. Their responsibilities include installing and supporting software systems, managing downtime and other issues. Usually, there is also a bit of programming involved: they have to write programs (scripts) that automate regularly repeating tasks.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">DevOps engineers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (sometimes written in lowercase: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">devops</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">) acts as a boundary between the hardware tasks of the administrator and the software tasks of developers. They can be developers who take part in the tasks related to the installation, testing and operation of infrastructures, or they can be system administrators, who are more confident in their programming skills and who understand and update the necessary codes. One important task of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">DevOps engineers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is to secure systems and to protect them against hacker attacks. An essential part of their job is to keep in contact with the development team, users and the system administrator, so they need great communication skills and they need to be able to work on team projects well.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">software architect</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> do?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The role of a software architect requires a lot of experience, and a wide range of skills and knowledge, and comes with great responsibility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software architects make decisions in questions of design and execution of a high level and know a wide variety of tools regarding technologies and possibilities in software design and development. They are usually present during communication with business partners and customers.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ethical hacker</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> do?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colloquially, we use the term “hacker” for people who abuse their IT knowledge and experience to break into computer systems without authorization in order to obtain data or cause damage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ethical hackers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have official authorization to assess the security of an IT system by attempting to gain access and obtain data, under a contract. They use their experience and knowledge to test systems and uncover security problems. They document this process in detail and let the operator know about the flaws in security.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">software tester</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> do?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before a product can hit the market or can be handed over to the customer, a long series of tests are run to see if everything is working properly. There are two different types of testing methods—manual and automated testing.</span></p>
<p><b>Manual testers</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> take on the role of end-users and test the functions of the software (web page, application, etc.), documenting malfunctions. They also model individual situations, like what happens if the user accidentally touches the screen, or what error message she gets if she tries to log in with an invalid username. Manual testers usually test based on exact scenarios and always document the process thoroughly, giving feedback about bugs to developers. The procedures, protocol and necessary concepts can be learned within a few months, and after gaining some experience, you can get an IT job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During </span><b>automated testing</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the tester uses or creates tools specialized for testing instead of just going through a list of problems. Test automators are programmers, and test processes are developed by automator experts or teams.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the difference between a data analyst and a data scientist?</span></h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data analysts</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> clear up and change data, and they also help the team interpret and visualize it. Their main tools are Excel, SQL, R and data visualization tools like Tableau and Data Studio.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">D</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ata scientists</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lead complex projects, identify trends and patterns by analyzing data, create analyses and forecasts, and give information to support decision processes. They usually have high mathematical, statistical and programming skills. Their main tools are SASS, <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/en/beginners-guide-to-python-programming/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external">Python</a>, R, Tensorflow, Hadoop and Spark. It is a sought-after profession with a great salary, but its complexity requires knowledge and a lot of experience.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In many ways, the criteria for modern websites can be lumped together. Today, safety aspects, availability, performance, user- and mobile-friendliness are all basic requirements. The boundaries between these areas are starting to blur. You can hear UX and SEO in the same sentence more and more often.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google wants to offer the best user experience for people who are browsing through the search results, so more technical requirements are added to the ranking factors each year. If we want to carry out marketing activities on our website, or just want people to find and explore it, we have to adhere to some universal rules.</span></p>
<p><div style="width: 3394px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/67112/pexels-photo-67112.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;dpr=3&amp;h=750&amp;w=1260" alt="SEO helps your website to perform better" width="3384" height="2250" /><p class="wp-caption-text">SEO helps your website to perform better</p></div></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">SEO-friendly website</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take a WordPress template or a new framework, for example—one of the top marketing messages will probably be that the product is SEO-friendly. And if everything is SEO-friendly, then nothing is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the time, the label SEO-friendly only means that you can create SEO-friendly websites with a given product. Modern search engines have greater requirements for webmasters than using templates, though. When working on a website, it is recommended to take established <a href="https://yoast.com/what-is-technical-seo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">technical </a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">SEO requirements</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into account, so we can build healthy websites that are potentially viable for marketing purposes.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is a technical SEO?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical SEO is simply the “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">behind the scenes</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” elements of a website, which allows our site to get a ranking in search engines, and helps us direct organic traffic to it. Elements that are important for SEO are the structure of the website, the internal links, the redirects, the mobile-friendliness of the site, and the loading time—the list goes on and on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything that makes it easier for search bots to map and index your site can be called technical SEO. To get good rankings, you’ll need the other two areas of search engine optimization as well, content SEO and off-page SEO, but the basis for both of these is technical SEO.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why is technical SEO important?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A healthy website is a website that the users can use and search bots can access. The user-friendliness of a website, user experience and search engine optimization is getting more and more connected thanks to Google’s encouragement (or pressure). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web Vitals is the search giant’s initiative, and it “provides unified guidance about quality signals that are essential for all sites to deliver a great user experience on the web.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But why is technical SEO important? Without a strong technical base, your content, your websites won’t perform as well in search engines. Technical SEO is needed to make the most of your website.</span></p>
<p><div style="width: 1510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4050312/pexels-photo-4050312.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;dpr=3&amp;h=750&amp;w=1260" alt="SEO parts have an effect on the click-through rate too." width="1500" height="2250" /><p class="wp-caption-text">SEO parts have an effect on the click-through rate too.</p></div></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tips for a healthy website</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are hundreds of ranking factors, only a part of which are publicly known. But most of the known ranking factors are technical in nature. If you take these technical requirements into account when creating your website, you will be one step ahead of your competitors once the site goes live.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. On-page elements</span></h3>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Page title, URL title, meta description</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The page title, URL title, and meta description determine where your website will appear in search results. In addition to influencing clickthrough rates, content SEO elements also directly affect rankings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is recommended to give each of our pages a unique page title, a readable URL (we will come back to this later) and a meta description. From a technical point of view, it is important that these elements are placed in the &lt;head&gt; section of our page and that they can be customized.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to appear in the correct place, these elements need to be added by the person that uploads the content to the website. You should pay attention to the length of the elements as well. Only the first 60 or so characters of the page title appear in search results, and meta descriptions should be kept under 160 characters in length.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Headings and meta keywords</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Headings (H1, H2, H3&#8230;) don’t just direct your attention, they also affect the accessibility of the site positively, not to mention their SEO effects. So when optimizing for search engines, you should create a clear heading hierarchy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is recommended to display the page title, the title of the article / name of the product as H1 headings, the paragraphs as H2 headings, and sub-paragraphs as even lower level (H3, H4…) headings.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9774" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/unnamed0826.png" alt="" width="752" height="373" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/unnamed0826.png 752w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/unnamed0826-300x149.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 752px) 100vw, 752px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Google frequently communicates that their algorithm can interpret the content of pages without headings, experience has shown that headings do, in fact, matter. And even if it’s true that Google pays no special attention to headings, other search engines, like Bing or Yandex, continue to care about them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many websites still have meta keywords, even though </span><a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2009/09/google-does-not-use-keywords-meta-tag.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google doesn’t take these into account since 2009</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If meta keywords have no other function than to direct traffic somewhere, you shouldn’t bother with them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12018 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. SSL certificate</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SSL certificate creates a secure, encrypted channel between client and server, making the use of your website safe. When a user sends information to your website, like credit card data or contact details, it’s much less likely that the information will get into the wrong hands, since the SSL will protect you from it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Search engines and browsers prefer safe websites. Most browsers even have a “not safe” warning before loading HTTP websites, and </span><a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in 2014, Google officially announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the use of SSL certificates is a ranking factor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a common mistake when a website owner buys the SSL certificate but doesn’t set up the redirects on a domain level, so both the HTTP and HTTPS versions of the website become available. It is recommended to redirect all versions to a single domain prefix (https:// or </span><a href="https://www/" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.) with a .htaccess file using </span><a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/7430/what-is-a-301-redirect-and-why-should-you-care.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">301 redirects</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></a></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. The loading speed of the site</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do you think, how long is a visitor generally willing to wait for a website to load? 6 seconds. If your website doesn’t load in six seconds, you will almost immediately turn visitors away. </span><a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/data/page-load-time-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Google</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, if a website loads in 3 seconds instead of 1, the bounce rate goes up by 32%. The loading speed of your site is not only important for user experience and conversion, but it is also a </span><a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2018/01/using-page-speed-in-mobile-search.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ranking factor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what can you do to increase the traffic of your site and provide a better user experience, while not wasting your visitors’ time?</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use pictures in their proper size. Don’t upload an image with a 2000&#215;3000 resolution if you want to use it as a 20&#215;30 logo. Use </span><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">responsive images</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compress your files. Compression lowers the size of image, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript files, so the website loads faster.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Install a cache plugin. Cache plugins save the static version of your website, so returning visitors can load the site significantly faster.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><div style="width: 1890px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/326503/pexels-photo-326503.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;dpr=2&amp;h=650&amp;w=940" alt="Technical SEO is a must have if you want your site to perform better." width="1880" height="1253" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Technical SEO is a must have if you want your site to perform better.</p></div></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Mobile-friendly websites</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The change in user needs and the ever-growing use of mobile phones demanded the development of mobile-friendly websites. If your website is not mobile-friendly in 2020, you’re starting with a significant disadvantage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google started favoring the mobile version of sites instead of the desktop one </span><a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2016/11/mobile-first-indexing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">as early as 2016</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but today, Google indexes the mobile version of websites </span><a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2020/03/announcing-mobile-first-indexing-for.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">by default</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would you like to test the mobile-friendliness of your website? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use this </span><a href="https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Testing tool by Google</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">!</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. URL structure</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be it online stores or content-driven magazine pages, if your URL has IDs and a bunch of special characters, it won’t appeal to visitors, nor search bots. If you adhere to a few useful rules when creating the URL structure, you can save yourself from a lot of 301 redirects, provide better user experience, and achieve better ranking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tips for creating the right URL structure:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The URL address should contain the focus keyword of your website.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use lowercase characters.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use forward slashes (/) for separating URL elements. Do: bpdigital.hu/seo-course/on-page-seo Don’t: bpdigital.hu/seo-course#on-page-seo</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use short, descriptive URL addresses.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid special characters (#, %, &amp;) in your URL addresses. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A healthy website has many elements that we can’t touch on in a short article, but the tips above can be an excellent basis for building a user-friendly, findable, and fast website.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Landing those first few developer roles in your career can be hard.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you convince someone to hire you when you have limited experience? What things are critical to know? What if you get asked a question you don’t know the answer to?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> need to know </span><a href="https://twitter.com/ppk/status/963850873003757569" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">how to write a &lt;link&gt; tag from scratch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Spoiler: you don’t).</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve been working as a web developer for about a decade. I’ve held various roles in companies of all shapes and sizes — from global tech companies to small local agencies. I’ve been interviewed more times than I can count, and I’ve had more rejections than successes. As I have progressed to more senior positions, I increasingly find myself on the other side of the table.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m going to share some things that I look for when I’m interviewing new candidates. Perhaps more importantly, they are things that have helped me feel more confident when I’m the one being interviewed.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The technical requirements of any given role will vary, so I won’t be giving you any suggestions about addressing those. There are plenty of articles with titles like </span><b>“10 Things Every Modern Web Developer Must Know”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You can use those to guide (or more likely, overwhelm) you.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What I am going to suggest, overall, is that you shouldn’t fret about the things you </span><b>don’t know</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>1. Be comfortable with your experience and abilities</b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking about your experience is usually the starting point for an interview. It’s also usually the first thing on your CV. Showing your experience and how you’ve applied your skills and abilities is a fundamental part of any interview process.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s normal to feel the pressure of making a good first impression. As such, it can be tempting to oversell yourself and your abilities, or to exaggerate the importance of a project you have worked on.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But you must remember — you’re not expected to have a wealth of experience or technical ability when starting out. Exaggerating or overselling your experience will create a less than ideal first impression, even if you’re otherwise well-suited for the role. This is something that is true at any point in your career, but it’s an easy trap to fall into when you’re starting out.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s much better to simply be factual about your experience and ability. Talk about the projects you’ve worked on and your specific role within those projects. Highlight the skills you used and technology you’ve been exposed to while working on them.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show, don’t tell.</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a principle in story-telling that I think also applies to job interviews.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t </span><b>tell</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> your audience what is happening, </span><b>show</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> them with actions and allow them to interpret it and arrive at a conclusion themselves.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if the interviewer can arrive at this conclusion by themselves:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This candidate is experienced with Y, and is clearly passionate about X”.</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is much more valuable than you telling them:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m highly experienced with Y, and very passionate about X”.</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equally as important as not overselling your skills and experience is being able to admit you don’t know something.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12028 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Testimonial-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><b>2. Don’t be afraid to say “I don’t know”</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s easy to feel pressured to answer a question you don’t know the answer to. If you do, this is what is likely to happen:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll copy/paste together snippets of information you’ve heard or read and regurgitate whatever comes to mind first. You’ll hope to hit on the right combination of words to answer the question. You’ll stumble, sound incoherent, and get flustered.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let me be as unambiguous about this as possible. Saying “I don’t know” when you don’t know the answer to something is </span><b>always</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the best answer. Don’t pretend to know something you don’t.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re made to feel uncomfortable for saying “I don’t know” in an interview, you should treat that as a red flag. It’s usually a sign of a toxic workplace. You don’t want to work at a company that doesn’t encourage vulnerability.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t know something, always be upfront and admit it. You can always follow up with what you think</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the answer might be. Even better, you can follow up with a question.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t know much about X, but I think it’s related to Y. Can you give me some more detail? Are you using X in your projects?</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often, the answer to your follow up questions will allow you to give a secondary response. Even though you didn’t know the answer, you can show that you understand the context.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12255 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>3. Ask questions. Lots of them.</b><b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asking follow up questions is also a great way to make an interview feel less formal and more like a discussion.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interviewers are often more than happy to talk about their experience with a particular technology, or the challenges they’ve faced on a particular project. This can also help give you insight into why they consider a certain skill or technology to be important for the role.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also remember that an interview is also about you evaluating your potential employer. You can’t properly evaluate them without asking questions.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What project will I be working on? What are some projects this company has recently completed? How large is the team I will be working in? What resources will be available to me for training and personal development?</span></i><br />
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This isn’t only something that is valuable for the interview. Making an objective evaluation of your options is a daily task for a developer. To do that, you need to gather the right information — and to do that, you need to ask questions. Lots of them.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>The candidate with the best technical skills isn’t always the one that gets hired.</b><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">My intention here isn’t to sound authoritative about what you should or shouldn’t do in an interview. Nor is it to proclaim that technical skills don’t matter.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, what I am trying to make clear is that learning isn’t linear. You can’t, and won’t, know </span><b>everything</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> required for a role. We all take different paths to get to where we are, and you should be comfortable with that fact.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every role is different, and every organization will have different expectations for their candidates. But, regardless of your skill level, or the expectations of the role, you should:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be comfortable with your current skill level and experience.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Know that it’s acceptable to say “I don’t know”.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feel confident asking questions about things you don’t understand.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I believe these principles are not only essential for doing well in interviews, but can help you succeed in every role you will ever have, at every level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hope there is something you can take away from this article or perhaps you have had success with different strategies.</span></p>

<h3><b>Before you learn to code, think about what you want to code</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing how to code is mostly about building things, and the path is a lot clearer when you have a sense of the end goal. If your goal is “learn to code,” without a clear idea of the kinds of programs you will write and how they will make your life better, you will probably find it a frustrating exercise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m a little ashamed to admit that part of my motivation for studying computer science was that I wanted to prove I was smart, and I wanted to be able to get Smart Person jobs. I also liked thinking about math and theory (</span><a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Godel-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this book</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> blew my mind at an impressionable age) and the program was a good fit. It wasn’t enough to sustain me for long, though, until I found ways to connect technology to the things I really loved, like music and literature.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12254 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-1-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what do you want to code? Websites? Games? iPhone apps? A startup that makes you rich? Interactive art? Do you want to be able to impress your boss or automate a tedious task so you can spend more time looking at otter pictures? Perhaps you simply want to be more employable, add a buzzword to your resume, or fulfill the requirements of your educational program. All of these are worthy goals. Make sure you know which one is yours, and study accordingly.</span></p>
<h3><b>There’s nothing mystical about it</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coding is a skill like any other. Like language learning, there’s grammar and vocabulary to acquire. Like math, there are processes to work through specific types of problems. Like all kinds of craftsmanship and art-making, there are techniques and tools and best practices that people have developed over time, specialized to different tasks, that you’re free to use or modify or discard.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/ThePerilsofJavaSchools.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This guy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (a very smart guy! Whose other writings I enjoy and frequently agree with!) posits that there is a bright line between people with the True Mind of a Programmer and everyone else, who are lacking the intellectual capacity needed to succeed in the field. That bright line consists, according to him, of pointers and recursion (there are primers </span><a href="http://alumni.cs.ucr.edu/~pdiloren/C++_Pointers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://inventwithpython.com/blog/2011/08/11/recursion-explained-with-the-flood-fill-algorithm-and-zombies-and-cats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the curious).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I learned about pointers and recursion in school, and when I understood them, it was a delightful jolt to my brain — the kind of intellectual pleasure that made me want to study computer science in the first place. But, outside of classroom exercises, the number of times I’ve had to be familiar with either concept to get things done has been relatively small. And when helping others learn, over and over again, I’ve watched people complete interesting and rewarding projects without knowing anything about either one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no point in being intimidated or wondering if you’re Smart Enough. Sure, the more complex and esoteric your task, the higher the level of mastery you will need to complete it. But this is true in absolutely every other field. Unless you’re planning to make your living entirely by your code, chances are you don’t have to be a recursion-understanding genius to make the thing you want to make.</span></p>
<h3><b>It never works the first time</b></h3>
<h4><b>And probably won’t the second or third time</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you first start learning to code, you’ll very quickly run up against this particular experience: you think you’ve set up everything the way you’re supposed to, you’ve checked and re-checked it, and it still. doesn’t. work. You don’t have a clue where to begin trying to fix it, and the error message (if you’re lucky enough to have one at all) might as well say “fuck you.” You might be tempted to give up at this point, thinking that you’ll never figure it out, that you’re not cut out for this. I had that feeling the first time I tried to write a program in C++, ran it, and got only the words “segmentation fault” for my trouble.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this experience is so common for programmers of all skill levels that it says absolutely nothing about your intelligence, tech-savviness, or suitability for the coding life. It will happen to you as a beginner, but it will also happen to you as an experienced programmer. The main difference will be in how you respond to it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve found that a big difference between new coders and experienced coders is faith: faith that things are going wrong for a logical and discoverable reason, faith that problems are fixable, faith that there is a way to accomplish the goal. The path from “not working” to “working” might not be obvious, but with patience you can usually find it.</span></p>
<h3><b>Someone will always tell you you’re doing it wrong</b></h3>
<p><a href="http://theprofoundprogrammer.com/page/17" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Braces should go on the next line</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/2782" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Braces should go on the same line</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="http://derkarl.org/why_to_tabs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use tabs to indent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TabsAreEvil" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But tabs are evil</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You should </span><a href="http://mysqlstoredprocedure.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=51&amp;Itemid=40" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">use stored procedures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but actually </span><a href="http://www.tonymarston.co.uk/php-mysql/stored-procedures-are-evil.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you shouldn’t use them</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You should </span><a href="http://www.lanoie.net/classes/DHTML/programming/lectures/lecture.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">always comment your code</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But </span><a href="http://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2013/06/01/roc-rocks.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">good code doesn’t need comments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are almost always many different approaches to a particular problem, with no single “right way.” A lot of programmers get very good at advocating for their preferred way, but that doesn’t mean it’s the One True Path. Going head-to-head with people telling me I was Wrong, and trying to figure out if they were right, was one of the more stressful aspects of my early career.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re coding in a team with other people, someone will almost certainly take issue with something that you’re doing. Sometimes they’ll be absolutely correct, and it’s always worth investigating to see whether you are, in fact, Doing It Wrong. But sometimes they will be full of shit or re-enacting an ancient and meaningless dispute where it would be best to just follow a style guide and forget about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, if you’re the kind of person who enjoys ancient but meaningless disputes (grammar nerds, I’m looking at you), you’ve come to the right place.</span></p>

<h3><b>Someone will always tell you you’re not a real coder</b></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/prog.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HTML isn’t real coding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="http://the-shaolin.blogspot.ca/2007/12/why-vi-only-true-programmers-editor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t use vi, you’re not really serious</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="http://www.ericsink.com/entries/c_morse_code.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real programmers know C</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="http://www.zazzle.ca/real_coders_dont_do_windows_tees-235789605999466863" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real coders don’t do Windows.</span></a> <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/07/separating-programming-sheep-from-non-programming-goats.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some people will never be able to learn it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/05/please-dont-learn-to-code.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You shouldn’t learn to code</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2013/08/21/chase-felker-youre-not-a-computer-programmer-and-thats-ok/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re not a computer programmer (but I am)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Coding” means a lot of different things to a lot of different people, and it looks different now from how it used to. And, funnily enough, the tools and packages and frameworks that make it faster and easier for newcomers or even trained developers to build things are most likely to be tarred with the “not for REAL coders” brush. (See: “</span><a href="http://blog.enfranchisedmind.com/2009/04/return-of-the-real-programmer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Return of the Real Programmer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">”)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behind all this is the fear that </span><a href="http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2013/08/21/chase-felker-youre-not-a-computer-programmer-and-thats-ok/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">if “anyone” can call themselves a programmer, the title will become meaningless</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But I think that this gatekeeping is destructive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the tools that make it easiest to build the things you want to build. If that means your game was made in Stencyl or GameMaker rather than written from scratch, that’s fine. If your first foray into coding is HTML or Excel macros, that’s fine. Work with something you feel you can stick with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you get more comfortable, you’ll naturally start to find those tools limiting rather than helpful and look for more powerful ones. But most of the time, few people will ever even look at your code or even ask what you used — It’s what you make with it that counts.</span></p>
<h3><b>Worrying about “geek cred” will slowly kill you</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">See above. I used to worry a lot, especially in school, about whether I was identifying myself as “not a real geek” (and therefore less worthy of inclusion in tech communities) through my clothing, my presentation, my choice of reading material and even my software customization choices. It was a terrible waste of energy and I became a lot more functional after I made the decision to let it all go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to internalize this: your ability to get good at coding has </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">nothing</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to do with how well you fit into the various geek subcultures. This goes double if you know deep down that you’ll never quite fit. The energy you spend proving yourself should be going into making things instead. And, if you’re an indisputable geek with cred leaking from your eye sockets, keep this in mind for when you’re evaluating someone else’s cred level. It may not mean what you think it does.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-7777 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/business-3560932_1920-3.jpg" alt="With a few advice i'ts always easier to learn, how to code" width="1920" height="1280" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/business-3560932_1920-3.jpg 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/business-3560932_1920-3-300x200.jpg 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/business-3560932_1920-3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/business-3560932_1920-3-768x512.jpg 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/business-3560932_1920-3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/business-3560932_1920-3-1080x720.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<h3><b>Sticking with it is more important than the method</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no shortage of articles about the “right” or “best” way to learn how to code, and there are lots of potential approaches. You can learn the concepts </span><a href="http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">from a book</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or by </span><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">completing interactive exercises</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or by </span><a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/intro.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">debugging things that others have written</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And, of course, there are lots of languages you might choose as your first to learn, with advocates for each.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A common complaint with “teach yourself to code” programs and workshops is that you’ll breeze happily through the beginner material and then hit a steep curve where things get more difficult very quickly. You know how to print some lines of text on a page but have no idea where to start working on a “real,” useful project. You might feel like you were just following directions without really understanding and blame the learning materials.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://codeberryschool.com/en/all-access-self-paced" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12255 size-full" src="https://codeberryschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="340" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-300x100.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Self-paced-2-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you get to this stage, most of the tutorials and online resources available to you are much less useful because they assume you’re already an experienced and comfortable programmer. The difficulty is further compounded by the fact that “you don’t know what you don’t know.” Even trying to figure out what to learn next is a puzzle in itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll hit this wall no matter what “learn to code” program you follow, and the only way to get past it is to persevere. This means you keep trying new things, learning more information, and figuring out, piece by piece, how to build your project. You’re a lot more likely to find success in the end if you have a clear idea of why you’re learning to code in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you keep putting bricks on top of each other, it might take a long time but eventually, you’ll have a wall. This is where that faith I mentioned earlier comes in handy. If you believe that with time and patience you can figure the whole coding thing out, in time you almost certainly will. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
